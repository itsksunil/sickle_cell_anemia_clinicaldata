NCT06581900,Study of Vitamin B12 Metabolism in Children With Sickle Cell Disease Exposed to MEOPA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06581900,RECRUITING,"Short description of the protocol intended for the lay public. Include a brief statement of the study hypothesis (Limit : 5000 characters) The sickle cells anemia is a monogenic disease linked to the presence of Hemoglobin S due to a mutation in the Hemoglobin Beta chain. The lack of circulating oxygen induces a polymerization of the Hemoglobin S which change the red cell conformation into sickle. Those cells interact and causes vaso-occlusive crisis (CVO).

The MEOPA is a medical gas used as an antalgic and a sedative especially in sickle cells disease patients. The nitrous oxide, oxide the cobalt ion in the vitamin B12 which inactivate it irreversibly creating a functional deficiency.

During the metabolism of vitamin B12, homocysteine is transformed in methionine which is used in to form the myelin sheath and helped in producing DNA. Numerous studies already shown that the longer the exposition to MEOPA is the greater the functional deficiency of vitamin B12 occur.

A few studies shown a symptomatic deficiency of vitamin B12 due to the exposition of MEOPA in sickle cells patient but there is no explanation on the necessary amount of exposure or if some patients are more at risk. When there is a deficiency of vitamin B12 the symptoms can go from a simple orthostatic hypotension to a combined spinal sclerosis.

The participation to the study will be proposed to every patient hospitalized for a CVO in the follow up of the emergency room visit or directly in pediatric reanimation. During a usual blood test, a small amount of blood (4mL) will be collected in addition to dose the Vitamin B12, the vitamin B9, the homocysteine, and the methionine. A small amount of urine will also be collected to dose the methylmalonic acid, all those elements are a part of the metabolism of B12 vitamin.

The same sample will be taken on the day of departure of the hospital. During the hospitalization the pain management, a daily neurological exam, and the exposition to the MEOPA will be assessed meticulously.

An appointment will take place at 7 days and at one month after the hospital departure to evaluate the possible neurological defect.

NCT02972138,Vitamin D and Bisphosphonates in the Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02972138,COMPLETED,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a worldwide distributed hereditary red cell disorder, which affects approximately 75,000 individuals in the United States and almost 20,000- 25,000 subjects in Europe, this latter mainly related to the immigration fluxes from endemic areas such as Sub-Saharian Africa to European countries. Studies of global burden disease have pointed out the invalidating impact of SCD on patient quality of life. This requires the development of new therapeutic options to treat sickle cell related acute and chronic complications. SCD is caused by a point mutation in the β-globin gene resulting in the synthesis of pathological hemoglobin S (HbS). HbS displays peculiar biochemical characteristics, polymerizing when deoxygenated with associated reduction in cell ion and water content (cell dehydration), increased red cell density and further acceleration of HbS polymerization. Pathophysiological studies have shown that dense, dehydrated red cells play a central role in acute and chronic clinical manifestations of SCD, in which intravascular sickling in capillaries and small vessels leads to vaso-occlusion and impaired blood flow with ischemic/reperfusion injury. In microcirculation, vaso-occlusive events (VOC) result from a complex and still partially known scenario, involving the interactions between different cell types, including dense red cells, reticulocytes, abnormally activated endothelial cells, leukocytes, platelets and plasma factors. Target organs, such as bone or lung, are involved in both acute and chronic clinical manifestations of SCD, related to their peculiar anatomic organization mainly characterized by sluggish circulation and relative local hypoxia. VOCs combined with marrow hyperplasia and inflammation has been suggested to contribute to the development of sickle bone disease (SBD). Recently, it has been proposed a possible role of vitamin D deficiency in SBD, which appears to be subordinated to the primary defect in bone homeostasis. In a humanized mouse model for SCD, we recently reported that SBD is due to imbalance between osteoblast/osteoclast activity induced by recurrent VOCs. In addition, we show that zoledronic acid prevents bone impairment related to SCD, reducing osteoclast activity and improving osteoblast performance.",NO,Sickle Cells Disease,,"Incidence of vertebral fracture, 5 years follow up","severity of vertebral fracture, 5 years follow up|Incidence of non-vertebral fracture, 5 years follow up",,Società Italiana Talassemie ed Emoglobinopatie,,ALL,ADULT,,80,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2010-01,2015-12,2017-09,"Ospedali Galliera - S.S.D.

- Some people with sickle cell disease have different health problems than others. This may be related to how easily and frequently the red blood cells break apart in the blood. Researchers want to test breath and blood samples from people with sickle cell disease to look for very small amounts of carbon monoxide, which is produced when red blood cells break apart. They will compare these results with breath samples from healthy volunteers. Studying different levels of carbon monoxide may help predict what health problems a person with sickle cell disease may get. It may also provide more information on possible treatments.

Objectives:

- To study breath carbon monoxide levels and their possible relation to the severity of sickle cell disease.

Eligibility:

* Individuals at least 18 years of age with sickle cell disease.
* Healthy volunteers who are matched for age, sex, and race with the sickle cell disease group.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a medical history.
* Participants with sickle cell disease will provide a blood sample and have a heart function test. They will also breathe into a bag to provide an exhaled breath sample.

World wide it is estimated that about 300,000 newborns are born every year. Of which 75% of them live in Sub-saharan Africa (SSA). In Uganda, about 15,000 babies are born with sickle cell disease per year.

In Uganda, the stroke prevalence was found to be 6.2% in children admitted to the National referral hospital in Kampala. Notable between 21 to 30% of these children presented with co-morbidities such as anaemia, bacteraemia and painfull crisis. Stroke in SCA is mediated by several mechanism such as cellular adhesions, inflammatory markers, hemolysis associated oxidative stress and hemostatic activation. Stroke in SCA is primarily a large vessel stroke and the mechanisim state above lead to a narrowing of the lumen of the cerebral arteries Arterial ischaemic stroke which occurs frequently in children with SCA has been associated with bacterial infections. Recent studies have shown that minor infections such as flu like infections can play a critical role in the trigger of stroke in children.

Our hypothesis is that viral flu infections is a key trigger for the risk of stroke in children with SCA. Our objective is to prevent the occurrence of flu illnesses in children with SCA thereby reducing the risk for stroke in our population of children with SCA.

Methods: A randomized controlled double blinded study Study site: The study will be conducted at the Sickle Cell Clinic (SCC), Mulago Hospital. Inclusion criteria: will be ;age between 2 years and 12 years;All children whose parents will have consented and those above 7years will have to assent. Exclusion criteria: all children with previous strokes; children who have acute illness and are not clinically stable; any child with previous documented adverse event following immunization (AEFI).

Sample Size: Using Open EPI calculator for cohort studies we calculated a total sample size of 136 participant to achieve our objective. Using a 95% confidence interval, power of 80% and an unexposed outcome of 25% (4) using a ratio of 1:1. Each arm will have 68 participants. With anticipated 10% loss to follow up a total sample size of 150 with each arm having 75 participants.

Study utility: Globally, stroke triggers have been recently identified independent of the existing risk factors such as high cerebral velocity speeds on TCDs. Flues like illnesses have been reported to be stroke triggers in children with arterial ischaemic strokes worldwide.This study may influence the role of influenza vaccination in the prevention of stroke triggers in children with sickle cell anaemia.

Thus, improvement of nutritional status in SCA holds the potential of ameliorating the course of the disease. Elevated haemolysis and its effects are associated with hypermetabolism and have resulted in higher rates of protein breakdown and synthesis, and energy expenditure. Offering more food has not optimized nutritional status and metabolic performance in free-living patients with SCA. Moreover, appetite might be suppressed. Supplementation with β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB), which is produced in the body from leucine, has been shown to have inhibitory effect on protein breakdown and to promote lean tissue synthesis in humans with sarcopenia. Also, HMB has been implicated as an ergogenic tool to promote exercise performance and skeletal muscle hypertrophy.

NCT00672789,Adherence to Hydroxyurea in Children With Sickle Cell Anemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00672789,COMPLETED,"Medication non-adherence is a true public health problem. Despite advancements in the molecular understanding of disease and improvements in therapy, patient health outcomes will not improve unless patients take prescribed medications regularly. Decreasing the gap between efficacious and effective therapy for patients with SCD is an essential research agenda. Hydroxyurea has been shown to be safe and efficacious in children and infants. However, the effectiveness of the prophylaxis depends on adherence to the recommended regimen. Medication adherence in SCD has previously been found to be sub-optimal in patients taking penicillin, desferoxamine, and pain medication. Adherence to HU has been studied to some extent in children with SCD. Based on estimates of adherence in other chronic illness we expect approximately 50% of patients to be \>80% adherent with their HU administration. There is no gold standard for improving adherence to treatment. There have been a few attempts in the SCD population to improve adherence. These include a day camp to promote education about desferoxamine and peer support, a combination of a slide-show about SCD and it complications, weekly phone calls by the clinic social worker and a calendar, and a seven-phase educational program. Given the striking improvements in the peripheral blood smear findings of patients with SCD on HU therapy, with reduction in the numbers of sickled cells, we hypothesize that viewing the peripheral blood smear of patients with poor adherence to HU compared to a blood smear of someone on HU can be used to improve adherence in non-adherent patients.

NCT00977691,Haploidentical PBMC Transplant for Severe Congenital Anemias,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00977691,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Background:

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT), which involves transplanting a donor's marrow stem cells, is capable of curing some congenital anemias. BMT usually involves high-intensity treatment with chemotherapy and radiation to kill abnormal cells, which affects all systems of the body.

People with anemias often have damage to other organs such as the kidneys, which can be further damaged by the chemotherapy. Only approximately 20 percent of patients have a full-matched donor, making treatment for many people with anemias unavailable. However, 90 percent of patients may have a half-matched donor, but using a half-matched donor increases the toxicity of BMT.

Objectives:

To determine if a research BMT with half-matched donor cells, low-intensity radiation, immunosuppressant drugs, and no chemotherapy will be effective in patients with sickle cell disease and Beta-thalassemia.

To determine the effectiveness of cyclophosphamide, an immunosuppressant drug, in preventing rejection of the donor cells.

Eligibility:

Recipients are individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with sickle cell disease and Beta-thalassemia, and who have a family member who is a haploidentical (i.e., half match) tissue match.

Donors are healthy individuals between the ages of 2 and 80 who are found to be suitable donors.

Design:

Donors will undergo apheresis, which involves withdrawing blood from one arm vein, passing it through a machine that removes bone marrow stem cells, and returning the remaining blood through the vein in the other arm. Donors will receive a drug that causes the stem cells to be released into the bloodstream prior to the apheresis procedure.

Recipients will undergo routine physical and laboratory examinations, including bone marrow sampling at the beginning of the study. After transplantation, physical and laboratory examinations will occur on a weekly or twice weekly basis at the outpatient clinic. Recipients will be examined every 6 months starting 100 days posttransplant for 5 years.

Recipients will receive low-dose radiation in two treatments 1 and 2 days before the transplant. They will also be given immunosuppressant therapy with alemtuzumab and sirolimus. Another immunosuppressant drug, cyclophosphamide, will be given in the future as needed to subsets of the recipients to prevent rejection of donor cells.

Recipients will receive the donor stem cells through a previously inserted central line. The process takes up to 8 hours.

Recipients will receive blood transfusions as necessary to prevent anemia and bleeding during the posttransplant period. They may also receive intravenous antibiotics to prevent infection.",YES,Sickle Cell Anemia,PROCEDURE: PBSC Transplant|DRUG: Alemtuzumab|DRUG: Sirolimus|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|PROCEDURE: Low Dose Irradiation,"Patients With Donor Type Hemoglobin, Percentage of patients post transplant with sustained donor type hemoglobin on hemoglobin electrophoresis, 1 year","Chimeric Value That is Required to Maintain Graft Survival and Hematologic Normalcy., Define the level of chimerism required to maintain graft survival and hematologic normalcy.

NCT00783627,Sickle Cell Disease and Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00783627,COMPLETED,"Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is the most prevalent genetic disease of haemoglobin.The underlying abnormality in the red blood cell (RBC) of SCD is the presence of abnormal sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS), which, when deoxygenated, becomes relatively insoluble, forms aggregates with other hemoglobin molecules within the RBC and causes rigid deformation of the cell. Acute pain vaso-occlusive crisis, strokes and acute chest syndrome are the main acute complications, sometimes life-threatening, often leading to organic and functional squeal. Although the common SS form of SCD is a unique gene disorder, the range of the clinical severity is remarkably wide and striking, suggesting that clinical polymorphism is due to modifier genes and environmental factors.Most of the research efforts have been focused on the biology of haemoglobin and of the red cells. Meanwhile, the complex pathophysiology of SCD is undoubtedly influenced by the many physiologic functions of the vascular wall. In line with this hypothesis are several reports of increased circulating levels of endothelium-derived surface molecules in SCD patients suggesting marked endothelial stress in SCD. Similarly, other processes that involve the endothelium, such as leukocyte adhesion and activation, may play a role in vascular occlusion. This accumulation of data raises the unanswered question of the mechanisms of endothelium maintenance and regeneration in SCD. Through these mechanisms, it is likely that function or dysfunction of the vascular endothelium contributes to the overall vascular pathobiology of this disease, which includes recurrent vaso-occlusions, stroke, leg ulcers, chronic organ ischemic damages, and neovascularizing retinopathy that affect nearly one-half (48%) of the surviving patients by the fifth decade.Thus, our groups have combined their respective clinical and biological expertises to test the hypothesis that SCD is a condition of specific endothelial stress and dysfunction upon chronic and Paracystic abnormal interactions with circulating cells and abnormal oxygen delivery to tissues. Specifically, we hypothesize that chronic endothelial stress with detachment of activated endothelial cells require increases mobilisation of the Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs) that maintain endothelial homeostasis to avoid major thromboembolic events and vasospasm.

Although all SCA patients share the same genetic mutation, the clinical complications are highly variable with some patients experiencing frequent and severe complications, while others have few serious complications. If SCA severity could be predicted early in life, those patients at greatest risk for complications could receive treatment prior to the onset of organ damage. No general SCA severity predictor or one that can be informative early in life exists. The investigators preliminary research has identified the absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) as a potential early predictive risk marker for SCA complications in pediatric patients. A higher ARC between ages 2 and 6 months of age is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization in the first 3 years of life; the mean ARC for the 36 patients who were hospitalized for SCA complications was significantly higher than that of the remaining 23 in those who were not hospitalized.

NCT04476277,Red Cell Half Life Determination in Patients With and Without Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04476277,COMPLETED,"Background:

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder. It results from a single genetic change (mutation) in red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs are the cells that carry oxygen to the body. In people with SCD, some RBCs are abnormal and die early. This leaves a shortage of healthy RBCs. Researchers want to learn more about how long RBCs live in the human body.

Objective:

To study how long RBCs live in people with and without SCD.

Eligibility:

People age 18 and older who either have SCD, had SCD but were cured with a bone marrow transplant, have the sickle cell trait (SCT), or are a healthy volunteer without SCD or SCT

Design:

Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will give a blood sample.

Participants will have a small amount of blood drawn from a vein. In the laboratory, the blood will be mixed with a vitamin called biotin. Biotin sticks to the outside of RBCs without changing their function, shape, or overall lifetime. This process is known as biotin labeling of RBCs. The biotin labeled RBCs will be returned to the participant via vein injection.

Participants will give frequent blood samples. Their RBCs will be studied to see how many biotin labeled RBCs remain over time. This shows how long the RBCs live. Participants will give blood samples until no biotin labeled RBCs can be detected.

During the study visits, participants will report any major changes to their health.

NCT01788631,A Phase II Trial of Regadenoson in Sickle Cell Anemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01788631,COMPLETED,"This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug called Regadenoson (or Lexiscan) to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease, in this case Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). ""Investigational"" means that the drug is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved the drug for your type of disease.

SCD is an inherited blood disorder that causes the red blood cells to change their shape from a round shape to a half-moon/crescent or sickled shape. People who have SCD have a different type of protein that carries oxygen in their blood (hemoglobin) than people without SCD. This different type of hemoglobin makes the red blood cells change into crescent shape under certain conditions. Sickle-shaped cells are a problem because they often get stuck in the blood vessels blocking the flow of blood, and cause inflammation and injury to important areas in the body.

Regadenoson (trade name Lexiscan) is a drug that may prevent this inflammation and injury caused by the sickle shaped cells. This drug is approved by the FDA to be used as a fast infusion during a heart stress test in people who are unable to exercise enough to put stress on their heart by making the heart beat faster. Regadenoson has been studied as a long infusion at this dose in adults, and no safety issues have been identified (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01085201). This is the first study to look at patient benefit with the long infusion of the drug. This drug has been used in laboratory experiments and information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to protect the body from damage caused by sickle-shaped cells in this research study.

NCT02394587,MBSR for Pain Catastrophizing in SCD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02394587,COMPLETED,"Significance: The purpose of this exploratory study is to test the feasibility, accessibility, and effects of a mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR) on reducing pain catastrophizing in persons with sickle cell disease (SCD) and chronic pain. One of the most difficult symptoms for SCD patients to manage is chronic pain. Approximately one-third of SCD patients experience chronic pain, which is associated with pain catastrophizing. Pain catastrophizing is a negative mental state toward pain stimuli and pain experience, and is associated with increased pain severity, pain interference, and lower social functioning, physical functioning, and mental health. There have been no psychobehavioral intervention studies that have attempted to alter the experience of pain catastrophizing in persons with SCD. MBSR is a complementary group-based therapy that emphasizes nonjudgmental awareness of thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations. With no pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment for catastrophizing in persons with SCD, MBSR offers a potential solution to this highly significant problem for both SCD patients and providers. This project will be the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of MBSR to reduce pain catastrophizing, and improve quality of life for SCD patients with chronic pain.

Methods: This study will enroll 60 adult patients with SCD and chronic pain from the Duke Adult Sickle Cell Clinic. Patients will be randomized to a MBSR or wait-listed control group. The MBSR group will complete a 6- week, group-based telephonic MBSR program that is administered by a certified MBSR clinician once a week for 90 minutes. MBSR feasibility, acceptability, and effects on pain catastrophizing will be assessed by questionnaires at baseline, week 1, 3, and 6 in both groups.

NCT00056433,Evaluation of Hydroxyurea Plus L-arginine or Sildenafil to Treat Sickle Cell Anemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00056433,COMPLETED,"Patients with sickle cell disease have abnormal hemoglobin (the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body). This abnormality causes red blood cells to take on a sickle shape, producing disease symptoms. Fetal hemoglobin, a type of hemoglobin present in fetuses and babies, can prevent red cells from sickling. The drug hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin production in patients with sickle cell disease by making a molecule called nitric oxide. The drugs L-arginine and Sildenafil (Viagra) increase the amount or the effect of nitric oxide. This study will evaluate:

* The safety of giving L-arginine or Sildenafil together with hydroxyurea in patients with sickle cell disease;
* The effectiveness of L-arginine plus hydroxyurea or Sildenafil plus hydroxyurea in increasing fetal hemoglobin in patients with sickle cell disease; and
* The effectiveness of L-arginine plus hydroxyurea or Sildenafil and hydroxyurea in lowering blood pressure in the lungs of patients with sickle cell disease. (Pulmonary blood pressure is elevated in about one-third of patients with sickle cell disease, and this condition increases the risk of dying from the disease.)

Patients with hemoglobin S-only, S-beta-thalassemia, or other sickle cell disease genotype may be eligible for this study.

Before starting treatment, patients will have a complete medical history and physical examination. All patients will take hydroxyurea once a day every day by mouth for at least 2 months. They will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center to take their first dose of hydroxyurea, and will have blood drawn through a catheter (plastic tube placed in a vein) every hour for 6 hours for tests to determine nitric oxide levels. After discharge, they will return to the clinic once every 2 weeks to check for treatment side effects and for blood tests to monitor hemoglobin and fetal hemoglobin levels. After fetal hemoglobin levels have been stable for 2 months, patients will be admitted to the Clinical Center for their first dose of L-arginine (for men) or Sildenafil (for women). Again, blood samples will be collected through a catheter once an hour for 6 hours. If there are no complications, patients will be discharged and will continue taking hydroxyurea once a day and L-arginine or Sildenafil three times a day for at least 3 months until fetal hemoglobin levels have been stable for at least 2 months. Patients will return to the clinic for blood tests every week for 2 weeks and then every 2 weeks to monitor hemoglobin and fetal hemoglobin levels and to check for treatment side effects.

Patients will have eye examinations before and during treatment. Some patients with sickle cell disease develop abnormalities in the blood vessels of the eye. Also, Sildenafil can cause temporary changes in color vision. Rarely, more serious eye problems can occur, such as bleeding from the eye blood vessels or damage to the retina a layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye. Patients will also have an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) before beginning treatment, after hydroxyurea treatment, and after 1 and 3 months of combined treatment with hydroxyurea and L-arginine or Sildenafil to help measure blood pressure in the lungs.

Patients who develop complications from L-arginine or Sildenafil may continue in the study on hydroxyurea alone.

It is hoped that the result will reverse the effect of decreased flow of blood due to sickled cells-that is, cells that have changed into the shape of a crescent or sickle. Sickle cell disease is the most common genetic disease affecting African Americans. About 8% of that population has the sickle cell trait. The changed cells can become attached to blood vessels, decreasing blood flow to vital organs. There can be the loss of needed proteins, including hemoglobin, that deliver oxygen throughout the body.

Adults at least 18 years of age who have the SS form of sickle cell disease or S-beta-thalassemia, are in either a steady state or crisis, give informed and written consent for participation, and have had a negative pregnancy test may be eligible for this study. Adults with any other disease that puts them at risk for reduced circulation are not eligible. Women who are breastfeeding are not eligible.

Participants will undergo a medical history, including family medical history, and a detailed physical evaluation, to take about 1 hour. There will be a collection of blood; echocardiogram, which involves taking a picture of the heart and its four chambers; and measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and NO. A procedure called orthogonal polarization spectral imaging will be performed. A small object the size of a Popsicle stick will be placed under the tongue or on a fingertip. This procedure presents a picture of blood flow and how the red blood cells appear as they circulate through blood vessels. The study will be conducted in the Vascular Laboratory/Cardiovascular Floor or Intensive Care and will last about 4 hours.

During the study, patients will lie in an adjustable reclining bed and chair. Small tubes will be placed in the artery and vein of the forearm at the inside of the elbow. A small pressure cuff will be applied to the wrist and a larger one to the upper arm. Both cuffs will be inflated with air. A strain gauge, resembling a rubber band, will go around the widest part of the forearm. When the pressure cuffs fill with air, blood will flow into the arm, and information from the strain gauge will be recorded. Between administrations of each medicine, there will be 30-minute rests. Normal saline will be put into the small tube in the artery. Measurements of the blood flow in the forearm will be taken, and a small blood sample will be taken to measure blood counts, proteins, and other natural body chemicals. Then a medicine called sodium nitroprusside, which causes blood vessels to expand and increase blood flow, will be placed into the forearm. It will be given at three different doses for 3 minutes each, with measurements recorded after each dose. Then a medicine called L-NMMA will be placed into the forearm. L-NMMA generally decreases local blood flow by preventing nitric oxide from being produced in the cells lining the blood vessels. It will be given at two different doses for 5 minutes each, with blood flow measured after each dose. Next, nitrite will be placed in the forearm at three different doses for 5 minutes each. Before and after nitrite is given, the researchers will measure the amount of the NO, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide that the patients breathe out. Then the procedure for administering normal saline, sodium nitroprusside, and L-NMMA will be repeated, as will a blood test.

This gas is continuously produced by cells that line the blood vessels. It is also transported from the lungs by hemoglobin in red blood cells. This study will examine how this gas regulates blood vessels and blood flow in people with sickle cell anemia. It will also look at a possible benefit of using certain genetic information to compare the white blood cells of people with sickle cell anemia to those without the disease.

Patients with sickle cell anemia and healthy normal volunteers 18 to 65 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, cardiovascular physical examination, electrocardiogram and routine blood tests. Participation of volunteers without sickle cell anemia will be limited to a single blood draw for genetic study. Sickle cell disease patients will undergo the following procedures:

Patients will lie in a reclining chair during the study. After administration of a local anesthetic, small tubes will be inserted through a needle into the artery and vein of the patient's forearm. These are used to measure blood pressure and draw blood samples during the study. Forearm blood flow will be measured using pressure cuffs placed on the wrist and upper arm, and a strain gauge (a rubber band device) placed around the forearm. When the cuffs are inflated, blood flows into the arm, stretching the strain gauge, and the flow measurement is recorded. A small lamp will be positioned over the hand. Light reflected back from the hand provides information about nitric oxide and hemoglobin in the blood of the skin. A squeezing device called a dynamometer will be used to measure handgrip strength.

Baseline blood flow, nitric oxide, hemoglobin, and handgrip will be measured after an infusion of glucose (sugar) and water. These measurements will be repeated at various times before, during and after administration of small doses of the following drugs:

* Sodium nitroprusside - causes blood vessels to dilate and increases blood flow to the heart
* Acetylcholine - causes blood vessels to dilate and slows heart rate
* LNMMA - decreases blood flow by blocking the production of nitric oxide

There will be a 20- to 30-minute rest period between injections of the different drugs.

When the above tests are completed, the patient will breathe a mixture of room air and nitric oxide for 1 hour through a facemask placed over the face, after which forearm blood flow and light reflected from the hand will be measured. Then the patient will do the handgrip exercise for 5 minutes, after which blood flow and hand lamp measurements will be taken. After a 20-minute rest period (with continued breathing of room air/nitric oxide), L-NMMA will be infused again. The handgrip exercise, blood flow and hand lamp measurements will be repeated. The face mask will then be removed, and the tubes will be removed 20 minutes later.

Blood samples will be collected at various times during the 5- to 6-hour study through the tubes in the arm.

Hydroxyurea (HU) is the only drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of sickle cell anemia. Although HU is used to treat small numbers of patients in Africa, cost, fear of toxicity, and lack of awareness and availability limit its use. The leukopenia that may be seen with HU raises the possibility of increased susceptibility to infection. Risk stratification - i.e., identification of patients most likely to benefit- could focus therapy and provide confidence that the risk:benefit ratio is favorable. Several clinical measures of future risk are well defined and findings on modifier genes in the US, primarily related to fetal hemoglobin (HbF), have further improved risk prediction. Whether the genetic variants predict severity in Africa is not known. The investigators have established a SCD cohort in Ibadan, Nigeria. In the first phase of this research the investigators will implement clinical risk examinations and assess the relationship between clinical characteristics (including levels of HbF) and known genetic markers. As a proxy for a birth cohort, the investigators will compare the frequency of the genetic markers in adult patients (i.e., ""survivors"") to children.

A prior clinical trial at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) (BABYHUG, NCT01783990) demonstrated that a fixed dose (20 mg/kg/day) of hydroxyurea was safe and effective in decreasing SCA-related complications in very young children (9-18 months), and largely due to these findings, hydroxyurea is recommended to be offered to all children (≥9 months old) with SCA, independent of disease severity. Nevertheless, children in the treatment arm of BABYHUG continued to experience vaso-occlusive symptoms and to incur organ damage. In clinical trials of older children with SCA, intensification of hydroxyurea to a maximum tolerated dosage (MTD), defined by mild to moderate myelosuppression, may be associated with improved laboratory parameters compared to fixed lower-dosing, but the clinical benefits gained from dose intensification have not been described. Therefore, in this trial, children in the standard treatment arm will receive a fixed dose of hydroxyurea (20 mg/kg/day), and participants in the experimental arm will receive hydroxyurea intensified to MTD, defined by a goal absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1500-3000 cells/µL. This trial aims to establish a multicenter infrastructure that will identify, enroll and randomize very young children (9-36 months) to receive fixed dose versus intensified-dose hydroxyurea in a single blinded manner, and to obtain prospective pilot data comparing the clinical and laboratory outcomes between the treatment arms to facilitate design of a definitive phase III trial.",YES,Sickle Cell Anemia,DRUG: Hydroxyurea,"Number of Patients Enrolled., A count of the number of patients enrolled will be provided., at baseline|Number of Patients Randomized, A count of the number of patients randomized will be provided., Eight weeks (± 2 weeks) after study enrollment|Number of Randomized Patients With ≥80% Chronic Medication Compliance, Chronic medication compliance is defined based on medication possession ratio (MPR), a measure of the percentage of time that a patient has access to medication.

NCT01000155,Efficacy of Vorinostat to Induce Fetal Hemoglobin in Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01000155,TERMINATED,"Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a hereditary anemia that causes the red blood cells to change their shape from a round and doughnut-like shape to a half-moon/crescent, or sickled shape. People who have SCD have a different type of hemoglobin (protein that carries oxygen). This different type of hemoglobin makes the red blood cells change into a crescent shape under certain conditions. Sickle-shaped cells are a problem because they often get stuck in the blood vessels blocking the flow of blood and can cause inflammation and injury to important areas of the body. All babies are born with hemoglobin called fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Soon after birth, HbF production slows down and another hemoglobin called adult hemoglobin (HbA) is made. Clinical studies have shown that increasing the amount of HbF in the blood may prevent sickling of the red blood cells. Vorinostat has been used in the treatment of cancers and in other research studies and information from those suggests that it may help treat SCD by increasing the amount of HbF in the blood.

The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PSV) is supposed to be poorly immunogenic in these patients. We want to evaluate whether a prime with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), able to induce immunologic memory, would improve the immune response against SP polysaccharides (SPP).

Primary objective: To evaluate and compare the specific antibody response to a prime-boost vaccine strategy combining PCV prime at W0 followed by the administration of PSV boost at W4, to the administration of PSV alone at W4 in patients with sickle cells disease.

Secondary objectives: Evaluation and comparison of the specific antibody response to the thirteen pneumococcal serotypes shared by the PCV and PSV vaccines, 4 weeks after the single PSV vaccination for patients from Group 1 or 4 weeks after the boost PSV vaccination for patients from group 2. Evaluation of the duration of the specific antibody response at W24 and 96. Evaluation of the T CD4 lymphocyte response to the CRM 197 protein. Safety of the vaccines.

Study Design: Randomised, monocentric, controlled phase II study of the immunological efficacy of a prime boost strategy combining the sequential administration of the PCV and PSV, compared to the administration of the PSV alone. 180 adults patients with sickle cells disease will be included. The primary endpoint : proportion of responders at W8 to at least 10 of thirteen serotypes. Secondary endpoints : Proportion of responders at W8 according to 4 categories of responders: 5-7; 3-4; 2-1 and 0.

Haemolysis, which results from the abnormality of the haemoglobin, and the vascular activation it causes, are responsible for multiple organ damage. Major sickle cell syndromes (MSC), by several mechanisms, are responsible for a wide range of renal damage, culminating in end-stage renal failure at an average age of 45 years and with an average survival of 3 years beyond ESRD.

The various renal disorders are : glomerular hyperfiltration and then glomerulosclerosis; tubular dysfunction, especially proximal and distal hyposthenuria (a factor in enuresis); papillary necrosis, renal infarction, episodes of acute renal failure during vaso-occlusive crises; dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system with early arterial hypertension and, more rarely, extra-membranous glomerulonephritis. In the early stages of these conditions, simple paraclinical tests can identify them before the appearance of specific clinical signs.

In patients suffering from MDS, the HAS (High Authority of Health) recommends an annual check-up carried out in a Competence Centre. According to the HAS recommendations for annual surveillance, in addition to the search for other organic complications, for renal pathology, only microalbuminuria and renal ultrasound are recommended.

NCT05469828,Crizanlizumab Improves Tissue Oxygen Supply Demand Matching in Patients With Sickle Cell Anemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05469828,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Hypothesis

Efficient unloading of oxygen to regions of high metabolic demand requires a healthy microvasculature to sense local oxygen tension and regulate flow, accordingly. In sickle cell disease patients, the investigators have demonstrated oxygen supply-demand mismatch, or SDM, in proportion to anemia severity. SDM occurs in both the peripheral circulation and the brain, and four characteristics: 1) Hyperemia beyond expected for the level of anemia, 2) Corresponding loss of vascular dilatory reserve, 3) Impaired oxygen unloading to the tissues, and 4) Tissue hypoxia. In sickle cell disease, red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) adhere to vascular endothelium triggering transient or irreversible microvascular damage as well as releasing vasoactive substances that contribute to microvascular dysregulation. The investigators postulate that ongoing microvascular damage/dysregulation in the setting of increased total blood flow contributes to SDM. The investigators believe SEG101, by lowering RBC and WBC adhesion to the microvasculature, will improve SDM and tissue oxygenation.

Objectives

* Primary - The investigators will test whether SEG101 improves SDM in patients with sickle cell anemia by measuring the change in tissue oxygenation measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).

NCT03249831,A Blood Stem Cell Transplant for Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03249831,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Blood stem cells can produce red blood cells (which carry oxygen), white blood cells of the immune system (which fight infections) and platelets (which help the blood clot).

Patients with sickle cell disease produce abnormal red blood cells. A blood stem cell transplant from a donor is a treatment option for patients with severe sickle cell disease. The donor can be healthy or have the sickle cell trait. The blood stem cell transplant will be given to the patient as an intravenous infusion (IV). The donor blood stem cells will then make normal red blood cells - as well as other types of blood cells - in the patient. When blood cells from two people co-exist in the patient, this is called mixed chimerism.

Most children are successfully treated with blood stem cells from a sibling (brother/sister) who completely shares their tissue type (full-matched donor). However, transplant is not an option for patients who (1) have serious medical problems, and/or (2) do not have a full-matched donor. Most patients will have a relative who shares half of their tissue type (e.g. parent, child, and brother/sister) and can be a donor (half-matched or haploidentical donor).

Adult patients with severe sickle cell disease were successfully treated with a half-matched transplant in a clinical study. Researchers would like to make half-matched transplant an option for more patients by (1) improving transplant success and (2) reducing transplanted-related complications.

This research transplant is being tested in this Pilot study for the first time. It is different from a standard transplant because:

1. Half-matched related donors will be used, and
2. A new combination of drugs (chemotherapy) that does not completely wipe out the bone marrow cells (non-myeloablative treatment) will be used to prepare the patient for transplant, and
3. Most of the donor CD4+ T cells (a type of immune cells) will be removed (depleted) before giving the blood stem cell transplant to the patient to improve transplant outcomes.

It is hoped that the research transplant:

1. Will reverse sickle cell disease and improve patient quality of life,
2. Will reduce side effects and help the patient recover faster from the transplant,
3. Help the patient keep the transplant longer and
4.

NCT00012545,Collection and Storage of Umbilical Cord Stem Cells for Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00012545,COMPLETED,"This study will determine the best ways to collect, process and store umbilical cord blood from babies with sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait and unaffected babies. Sickle cell disease is an abnormality of the hemoglobin in red blood cells that causes the cells to change shape and clump together, preventing their normal flow in the bloodstream. This impairs blood flow to various organs, and the resulting oxygen deprivation causes organ damage.

Cord blood is rich in stem cells (cells produced in the bone marrow that mature to different types of blood cells), which may prove useful in new sickle cell therapies. However, cord blood from babies with sickle cell trait, sickle cell disease and normal babies may act differently under laboratory conditions, so it is important to learn how best to work with blood from all three groups of babies for future use in possible treatments.

Pregnant women between 18 and 45 years of age who are at risk of having an infant with sickle cell disease and normal volunteers who are pregnant and not at risk for this disease may be eligible for this study. Potential participants will be counseled about donating her infant s blood in order to make an informed choice.

All women who participate in the study will provide a medical history and have blood collected from the umbilical cord and placenta (afterbirth) after the baby s delivery. The blood will be tested for various infectious diseases, processed, frozen and stored for research purposes. In addition, blood from women with babies at risk for sickle cell disease will be tested for the presence of the sickle cell gene, tissue typed, and used for research as follows:

* Sickle cell disease - If cord blood tests show the baby has sickle cell disease, the blood will be frozen for an indefinite period of time for possible use in future treatment of the child. This treatment could include stem cell transplantation or gene therapy, treatments are not currently considered routine for sickle cell disease.
* Sickle cell trait or normal hemoglobin - If cord blood tests show the baby has sickle cell trait or is unaffected, the blood will be processed and stored for up to 3 years, during which time it may possibly be used to treat a currently living or future sibling with sickle cell disease. After 3 years, the participant may agree to either have the blood discarded, given to research or moved to another facility for continued storage at the participant s expense, if there is a storage fee. Alternatively, if there is no anticipated future need for the collected blood, or if it does not meet standards needed for future treatment, it will be used in NIH-approved research studies.

Participants and their family doctor or the baby s pediatrician will be contacted twice a year for information about changes in the baby s health. Participants may also be asked permission to perform new tests developed by researchers.

NCT01356485,Safety Study of MP4CO in Adult Sickle Cell Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01356485,COMPLETED,"Sickle Cell Anemia is caused by an inherited hemoglobin disorder. Healthy red blood cells are discoid and can deform and move through small blood vessels to carry oxygen to all parts of the body. In sickle cell disease, as red blood cells circulate and oxygen is released in the circulatory system, the deoxygenated abnormal hemoglobin S can begin to polymerize. When this occurs, the red blood cells can become sticky and elongated. These sickled red blood cells are less flexible and will obstruct small blood vessels and block normal red blood cells from traveling through the circulatory system, which limits oxygen delivery to tissues and organs. This is known as a ""sickle crisis"".

Patients suffering from a sickle crisis experience severe pain and are at risk of stroke, heart attack or even death. By lowering the level of oxygen pressure at which sickling occurs and opening the vasculature and rapidly delivering oxygen directly to ischemic tissues, the addition of MP4CO to existing treatment protocols may alleviate pain associated with a sickle cell crisis, abort a crisis and/or potentially reduce the duration of a crisis.

These ""sickled"" red cells are less flexible and will obstruct small blood vessels and prevent normal red cells from circulating freely, which limits oxygen delivery to tissues and organs. This is known as a ""sickling crisis"" or ""vaso-occlusive crisis"" and is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients with Sickle Cell disease.

Patients suffering from a sickle crisis experience severe pain and are at risk of stroke, heart attack or even death. Current therapy is limited to hydration and symptomatic pain relief. The administration of MP4CO as an adjunct treatment to standard therapy may alleviate pain associated with a sickling crisis and potentially reduce the severity and duration of a crisis.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder where red blood cells, that carry oxygen, are stiff and become stuck in small blood vessels. As a result, affected patients can experience severe pain and serious organ damage. SCD can be cured with a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), that is, when they receive blood stem cells from a family donor. But HCT can also have serious side effects, especially in people with organ damage. Researchers want to find ways to make HCT safer for everyone.

Objective:

To test a new combination of drugs (briquilimab, abatacept, and alemtuzumab), used along with radiation, in people undergoing HCT for SCD.

Eligibility:

People aged 16 and older with SCD. They must be eligible for HCT and have a family member who is a good donor match. Donors must be aged 4 and older.

Design:

Participants with SCD will be screened. They will have blood tests and tests of organs including their heart and lung function. Donors will have blood drawn.

Participants with SCD will have a tube inserted into a blood vessel in their chest (intravenously). This line will remain in place up to 2 months; it will be used to draw blood and administer the donor cells and other medications.

Briquilimab will be administered intravenously 1 time, along with other drugs used to prepare for HCT.

NCT06464458,Optimizing the Management of Sickle Cell Patients on Hydroxyurea: The Value of Therapeutic Pharmacological Monitoring,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06464458,RECRUITING,"Brief Summary: \* A short description of the clinical study, including a brief statement of the clinical study's hypothesis, written in language intended for the lay public.

Limit: 5000 characters.

Severe forms of sickle cell syndrome are characterized by the occurrence of repeated vaso-occlusive crises (CVO), early complications and a high morbidity and mortality in these patients. Intensified management is then required, with the introduction of hydroxyurea treatment and then, if it proves ineffective, a transfusion program or even a haematopoietic stem cell allograft. These latter treatments present significant risks of adverse effects for the patient (haemochromatosis, erythrocyte alloimmunisation for the transfusion program, risk of GVH, chemotherapy-related toxicity, MVO for the allograft).

Hydroxyurea (HU) is the first treatment based on the specific pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. It is the first line of therapeutic intensification for adult patients and children (age ≥ 2 years) with major sickle cell disease. By mainly increasing the percentage of fetal haemoglobin (HbF), HU decreases the frequency of CVO, complications, hospitalizations and prolongs the life expectancy of patients.

The initial dose of HU, recommended by the ANSM, is 15 mg/kg/d once daily. However, the optimal dose cannot be predicted at the start of treatment, which is why a dosage adjustment is essential. The usual dose is between 15 and 35 mg/kg per day.

Typically, the dose is increased every 3 months until a mild myelosuppression tolerated by the patient is reached, indicating that the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been reached. When the dose of HU has reached the MTD, the ratio of clinical (reduced frequency of vaso-occlusive attacks) and biological (better % of HbF) benefits to risk (toxicity) is optimal for the patient.

The disadvantages of this practice are that:

* dose escalation can be long (9-12 months)
* clinicians may be reluctant to escalate HU to MTD
* patients are treated sub-optimally during the therapeutic adaptation period.

Recent work has shown that it is beneficial for the patient to adjust the initial dose using a pharmacological therapeutic approach in addition to monitoring haematological tolerance.

Thus, by customizing the dose of HU using an area under the curve (AUC) measurement at the initial intake of HU at a standardized dose (20 mg/kg/day), the MTD would be achieved in a faster time frame of 6-9 months.

The primary objective of our trial is to identify the methodology that will most effectively decrease the time to reach the MTD (therapeutic target). The immediate benefit will be a reduction in CVO which is the major clinical problem and leads to a risk of complications in sickle cell disease.",NO,Sickle Cell Disease,OTHER: management on hydroxyurea by therapeutic pharmacological monitoring,"Comparison of the time to obtained MTD in 2 groups of sickle cell patients on hydroxyurea with different treatment follow-up methodology: MTD follow up or therapeutic pharmacological monitoring, - Arm A (Control): The dosage adjustment is quarterly from M3 onwards and will be made on hematological (WBC) tolerance. The increase of the dosage in HU will be 5 mg/kg every 3 months (or 2.5 mg/kg in case of renal insufficiency with ClCr ≤ 60 ml /min) until MTD is achieved and within a limit of 35 mg/kg/day (max 2500mg).

- Arm B (Experimental): Dose adjustment will be done at the M3 visit based on the results of the Pharmacokinetic analysis (AUC) performed on the day of the first HU intake after inclusion. At the quarterly visits V1 (3 months) to V4 (12 months), a HU assay at time T = 2H associated with monitoring of hematological monitoring of hematological tolerance will be performed to verify the pharmacokinetic stability in the child after the dosage adjustment., Theoretical start date: January 2023 Duration of inclusion period: 30 months Duration of participation of each subject: 16 months Total study duration: 46 months",,,"University Hospital, Strasbourg, France",,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",NA,30,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2023-02-08,2025-08-07,2025-08-07,"Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, 67091, France",

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder. The disease affects the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen; this in turn can injure organs including the heart, lungs, and kidneys. SCD can lead to serious illness and death. Treatments such as bone marrow transplants and gene therapies can cure SCD, but they are not widely available. Current drug treatments for SCD are not always effective. This natural history study will examine how a study drug (mitapivat) affects red blood cells in people with SCD.

Objective:

To learn how mitapivat affects red blood cells in people with SCD.

Eligibility:

People with SCD who are enrolled in the parent study, NIH protocol IRB001565-H.

Design:

Procedures for this study will be done during visits already scheduled for the parent study.

Participants will have additional blood drawn during study visits. The additional amount will be about 3.5 teaspoons.

NCT06989567,A Study of Intravenous L-Citrulline in Patients Aged 6-21 Years Old With Sickle Cell Disease Presenting to Emergency Departments in Acute Vaso-Occlusive Crisis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06989567,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"This study is being done to learn more about a possible new treatment for pain episodes (called vaso-occlusive crises or VOCs) in children, teens, and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). The study will include about 120 participants between the ages of 6 and 21 who come to the emergency department (ED) with a VOC.

A VOC is a painful episode that happens with no clear cause and no signs of infection or major problems with organs like the liver or kidneys.

Before joining the study, patients and their families may be asked to learn about it and give permission (called consent or assent) while at a regular clinic visit. If that hasn't happened yet, the consent/assent process will happen at the emergency department when the patient comes in for care. If the patient meets all the study requirements, they can join the treatment part of the study.

Participants will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to receive either:

L-citrulline, the study drug, or A placebo, which looks the same but has no active ingredients.

Everyone has an equal chance of getting either one. The study drug is given through an IV. It starts with one larger dose, followed by a steady infusion for up to 12 hours.

All patients in the study will still receive the usual pain treatment (called standard of care), which may include opioids. However, some patients may need fewer opioids if the study treatment helps with their pain.

If any medicines are not allowed during the study, the doctor will explain this during the consent process.

Patients can go home once:

Their pain is controlled with oral (by mouth) pain medicine, They're eating and drinking well, and They've been given a personal pain management plan to use at home.

NCT06939933,Effect of Aquatic Exercises on Muscle Strength and Quality of Life in Children With Sickle Cell Anemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06939933,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Sickle cell anemia is a global public health disorder that aﬀects millions of people across the globe. It is an inherited autosomal recessive hemoglobin condition caused by a beta-globin gene mutation that results in an aberrant sickle cell hemoglobin molecule with glutamic acid replaced by valine at position six of the beta-globin chain.

Sickle cell anemia is a hereditary illness characterized by persistent microvascular blockage by sickle-shaped cells, chronic hemolytic anemia, and tissue destruction. Red-cell dehydration, hypoxemia, metabolic acidosis, and hyperthermia are typical vaso-occlusive triggers.

Children with sickle cell anemia frequently have poor growth and nutritional status, increased protein turnover, decreased lean body mass, and elevated resting and lower activity energy expenditures.

These clinical findings present a problem for recommending exercise when taken as a whole, while engaging in physical activity increases the chance of issues like a ""painful episode,"". Children with sickle cell anemia miss out on the favorable health effects of regular physical activity, such as the growth of lean body mass, strength, and fitness.

Vaso-occlusive events are recurring and prevalent in sickle cell anemia-related morbidity. Patients also have a higher chance of developing central nervous system conditions such cerebral vasculopathy and overt and covert stroke. It has been noted that the pathophysiological symptoms of SCA decrease skeletal muscle function. In fact, it has been demonstrated that individuals with SCA have diminished forearm and respiratory muscular maximal strength as well as peak locomotory muscle power.

Vaso-occlusion, chronic hemolytic anemia, and vasculopathy form the core of sickle cell anemia pathophysiology and result in both acute and chronic consequences that have a significant negative influence on quality of life QoL. Even though clinical care for children with SCA has significantly improved in developed countries over the past few decades, children and adolescents with SCA still have a lower quality of life than their peers due to painful vaso-occlusive crises, frequent hospital admissions, and lengthy hospital stays.

Generic and disease-specific measures of quality of life have been developed and validated in chronic illnesses to evaluate the influence of health on functional domains such physical and mental well-being, exhaustion, pain, social engagement, relationships, and emotional distress. Examples include the Child Health Questionnaire, Pediatric Quality of Life Sickle Cell Disease Module PedsQL SCD, and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System PROMIS, all of which have been used to study SCA and have revealed various degrees of quality-of-life impairment, primarily in the United States.

Health-related quality of life refers to the patient's assessment of how his or her well-being and level of functioning, in comparison to the perceived ideal, are influenced by personal health. A health-related quality of life assessment often considers physical, social, and emotional functioning in addition to academic and occupational performance.

Studies on the quality of life for people with SCA have significantly risen during the previous five years. Measurement of health-related quality of life is beneficial for many reasons. Health-related quality of life can be used to measure the efficacy and effectiveness of treatment interventions, to predict outcomes and resource use, and to direct therapy. More importantly, the measurement of health-related quality of life aids in understanding the burden of disease that patients experience.",NO,Sickle Cell Anemia in Children,OTHER: aquatic exercise in addition to physical exercise|GENETIC: designed physical exercises only,"assessing hand grip strength, Hand-held dynamometer for assessing hand grip strength, 3 months|assess weight, The Calibrated floor Health scale was used to assess weight, 3 months|assessing Lower limb, trunk muscles strength., 3- Lafayette dynamometer for assessing Lower limb and trunk muscles strength., 3 months|determine the child's standing height in centimeters (cm)., The calibrated floor health scale was used to determine the child's standing height in centimeters (cm)., 3 months|assessing Health related quality of life, 4- Pediatric quality of life inventory 3.0 generic for assessing Health related quality of life, 3 months",,,Kafrelsheikh University,,ALL,CHILD,NA,50,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2025-05-01,2025-09-01,2025-10-30,,

NCT05506358,Evaluation of Low-cost Techniques for Detecting Sickle Cell Disease and β-thalassemia in Nepal and Canada,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05506358,COMPLETED,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder associated with acute illness and organ damage. In high resource settings, early screening and treatment greatly improve quality of life. In low resource settings, however, mortality rate for children is high (50-90%). Low-cost and accurate screening techniques are critical to reducing the burden of the disease, especially in remote/rural settings. The most common and severe form of SCD is sickle cell anemia (SCA), caused by the inheritance of genes causing abnormal forms of hemoglobin (called sickle hemoglobin or hemoglobin S) from both parents. The asymptomatic or carrier form of the disease, known as sickle cell trait (SCT), is caused by the inheritance of only one variant gene from one of the parents. In areas such as Nepal, β-thalassemia (another inherited blood disorder) and SCD are both prevalent, and some combinations of these diseases lead to severe symptoms.

The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy of low-cost point-of-care techniques for screening and detecting sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait, and β-thalassaemia, which will subsequently inform on feasible solutions for detecting the disease in rural, remote, or low-resource settings. One of the goals of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of techniques, such as the sickling test with low-cost microscopy and machine learning, HbS solubility test, commercial lateral-flow assays (HemoTypeSC and Sickle SCAN), and the Gazelle Hb variant test, to supplement or replace gold standard tests (HPLC or electrophoresis), which are expensive, require highly trained personnel, and are not easily accessible in remote/rural settings.

The investigators hypothesize that:

1. an automated sickling test (standard sickling test enhanced using low-cost microscopy and machine learning) has a higher overall accuracy than conventional screening techniques (solubility and sickling tests) to detect hemoglobin S in blood samples

NCT06769139,Evaluation of the Impact of Red Blood Cell Exchange on Thrombo-inflammation in Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06769139,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited blood disorder worldwide. It is a hemoglobinopathy characterized by chronic hemolysis, endotheliopathy, coagulation activation, and chronic inflammation. It is a multisystemic disease leading to acute (vaso-occlusive crisis, acute chest syndrome, stroke...) and chronic complications with multiorgan damage. Thrombo-inflammation is defined by the cooperation and interaction between hemostasis and the innate immune system. The platelet represents the cornerstone of this phenomenon, being at the interface of these two systems. In sickle cell disease, platelets are activated and release cytokines, leading to a pro-coagulant and pro-inflammatory state. Transfusion, whether occasional or chronic, is a major sickle cell disease treatment. It is common to distinguish simple transfusion from exchange transfusion. The latter involves replacing a given volume of sickle red blood cells with healthy red blood cells. Exchange transfusion allows avoiding an excessive increase in hemoglobin. The decrease of hemoglobin S under 30% achieved by red blood cell exchange reduces the risk of stroke by more than 90% in children with cerebral vasculopathy. Moreover, transfusion can be used in acute complications such as vaso-occlusive crisis and acute chest syndrome. Despite this efficacy, a subgroup of patients is not totally protected against acute and chronic complications. The persistence of chronic inflammation is suggested. To date, it is not known if red blood cell exchange can reduce the thrombo-inflammatory dynamic in sickle cell disease. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of red blood cell exchange on thrombo-inflammatory parameters in 20 adult sickle cell patients (10 patients on manual exchange and 10 patients on automatized exchange).",NO,Sickle Cell Disease,OTHER: Red blood cell exchange,"Evaluation of thrombo-inflammation parameters in sickle patients treated by red blood cell exchange, Thrombo-inflammation is evaluate using a composite criteria composed by 4 thromo-inflammatory parameters : soluble platelet activation markers, inflammasome, platelet response, circulating platelet microparticles and lipidomic study of plasma eicosanoids., 2 days",,,"University Hospital, Toulouse",Etablissement Français du Sang,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,20,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2025-01,2025-12,2026-01,"Oncopole - Toulouse Hospital, Toulouse, 31059, France",

The vast majority of people with SCD in Africa do not receive evidenced-based health care (e.g., newborn screening, health education, prophylaxis for infection, optimal nutrition and hydration, blood transfusion, transcranial Doppler screening, and HU therapy), despite its effectiveness in reducing SCD-related adverse outcomes and mortality. The use of HU in SSA is \<1% among SCD patients. The investigators' preliminary findings indicate that provider-level barriers are significant and must be addressed to improve HU adoption. To address HU adoption, the investigators will use the NIH-funded study (e.g., Realizing Effectiveness Across Continents with Hydroxyurea (REACH) Clinical Trial (NCT01966731)) that developed an evidence-informed, clinical, practical, and easy-to-follow algorithm to 1) Screen patients for sickle cell disease (SCD), 2) Initiate HU treatment, and 3) Maintain HU dosage over time (SIM) for the improved management of SCD as our intervention. The Nigerian government released guidelines supporting the SIM intervention for HU adoption for improved SCD management, and HU is on the list of essential medicines for Nigeria. The investigators' implementation strategy for improving SCD management in Nigeria uses a practical and replicable evidence-based task-sharing strategy, TAsk-Strengthening Strategy for Hemoglobinopathies (TASSH), adopted from the TAsk-Strengthening Strategy for Hypertension control (TASSH) trials in Ghana and Nigeria containing the essential components of i) Training healthcare workers/providers to be more patient-centered in clinical consultations, ii) Clinical reminders, and iii) Practice facilitation (TCP) known as (TASSH TCP) for SCD management.

On the other hand, three recent prospective studies in children with sickle cell disease show prevalence of hypertension diagnosed by ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) ranging from 32 to 45% but on small numbers of patients (n = 54 at most). This hypertension appears to affect kidney function and has been previously associated with the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. It is therefore important to know the prevalence of hypertension in children with sickle cell disease and to determine its mechanisms. The factors which could explain this high prevalence are the increase in arterial stiffness and the increase in systemic vascular resistance linked to the alteration of the sympathovagal balance contributing to the regulation of vascular tone. Indeed, a disturbance of this balance with an increase in vasoconstrictor sympathetic tone has already been found. Hypothesis: In a subgroup of sickle cell children there is systemic hypertension (prevalence: main objective) linked to the alteration of the sympathovagal balance already established during sickle cell disease (increase in sympathetic tone and decrease in parasympathetic tone) affecting systemic vascular resistance (secondary pathophysiological objectives).",NO,Sickle Cell Disease,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Blood Pressure measurement,"Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM), mean, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, 2 years",,,Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",,200,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2021-06-01,2023-06-01,2023-06-01,"Robert Debre Hospital, Paris, 75019, France",

NCT05434000,Primary Prevention of Stroke in Children With Sickle Cell Anaemia in Nigeria in the Community,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05434000,RECRUITING,"The overall goal of this feasibility study is to establish a standard of care stroke prevention program for children with sickle cell anemia in a community hospital by task shifting stroke detection and transcranial Doppler ultrasound screening to nurses. In Nigeria, approximately 150,000 children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are born annually, accounting for more than half of the total births with SCA worldwide. In comparison, only 1,700 children with SCA are born in the United States annually. An estimated 11% of unscreened and untreated children at increase of strokes with SCA will have at least one stroke by 17 years of age. In high-income countries, evidence-based practices (EBP) for primary stroke prevention in children with SCA involves screening for abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) velocity (\>200cm/s) coupled with regular blood transfusion therapy for at least one year followed by treatment with hydroxyurea is considered standard care. This strategy decreases the risk of stroke by 92%. Due to safety and availability, regular blood transfusion is not a viable option for primary stroke prevention in most low-income settings, including Nigeria, where \~50% of the 300,000 children with SCA are born. Among each birth cohort, 15,000 children will have stroke annually in Nigeria. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) Central Nervous System Guidelines recommends moderate dose hydroxyurea (20mg/kg) to children with SCA with abnormal TCD measurements, living in resource-constrained settings where regular blood transfusions are not readily available. Our team has demonstrated in a previous trial the feasibility of primary stroke prevention with hydroxyurea in Kano, Nigeria. In 2016, as part of capacity building objective of Stroke Prevention Trial in Nigeria (1R01NS094041-SPRING) at Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital in Kaduna, TCD screening was adopted as standard of care. Before the trial, no TCD screening was done at our trial site in Kaduna. Now, as standard care, physicians at the teaching hospital do TCD screening, however, only 5.4% (1,101/20,040) of the eligible children with SCA living in Kaduna, Nigeria were reached. Clearly, for there to be an appreciable impact on decreasing the stroke rates in children with SCA living in Nigeria and elsewhere, applying the ASH guidelines and a better implementation strategy to increase the TCD reach (proportion of children eligible for TCD screening that are screened) is necessary. Therefore, objective of this physician-mentored application is to conduct an Effectiveness-Implementation Feasibility Trial is to test the test the hypothesis that the task-shifted site for primary stroke prevention team in a community hospital will have a non-inferior effectiveness in identifying children with abnormal TCD measurements when compared to primary stroke prevention team in a teaching hospital in Kaduna, Nigeria. the investigators will conduct i) a needs assessment at the community hospital to identify barriers and facilitators to the intervention, ii) Build capacity for stroke detection and TCD screening and iii) Compare the effectiveness of a physician-based stroke prevention program in a teaching hospital to a task-shifted stroke prevention in a community hospital.",NO,Sickle Cell Disease|Stroke,DRUG: Hydroxyurea,"Reach, The portion of children than received TCD screening at least once in the community hospital, 1 year|Effectiveness, The proportion of children with abnormal TCD measurement started on hydroxyurea, 1 year","Stroke occurrence, Proportion of children with SCA identified with stroke., 1 year|Clinical events among children on Hydroxyurea, Proportion of children in both teaching and community hospitals with abnormal TCD (200cm/s) measurements receiving hydroxyurea with: i) pain crises ii) fever iii) acute chest syndrome and iv)severe anemia (Hgb \<6g/dL)., 1 year|Clinical events among children not on Hydroxyurea, Proportion of children with SCA not on hydroxyurea with: i) pain crises ii) fever iii) acute chest syndrome and iv) severe anemia (Hgb \<6g/dL) in both teaching and community hospitals., 1 year",,Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital,,ALL,CHILD,NA,217,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: SCREENING,2021-01-06,2025-07-31,2025-07-31,"Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital/Kaduna State University, Kaduna, Nigeria",

These alterations lead to circulatory complications of which an emblematic example is the sickle cell crisis which manifests itself by microcirculatory occlusions. Several authors suggest that the deformability of erythrocytes is a key parameter for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients. Numerous studies, especially in vitro, show that the mechanical properties of the red blood cell significantly influence its dynamics in flow (blood viscosity, distribution in capillary networks). Moreover, concerning the specific problem of vaso-occlusion, the proportion of the most rigid red blood cells is a determining factor of the probability of occlusion more than the average value of this rigidity which can hide great disparities.

There is no clinically usable test to assess the alteration of the fine rheology of the red blood cell in a patient. Functional tests such as ektacytometry require heavy equipment and teams of specialized biologists; this technique is therefore only available in 3 biological reference centers in France. ""Mechanical phenotyping"" seems to be a potentially simpler and more accessible technique, and has already shown promising prospects in other nosological settings than red blood cell pathologies.

NCT04839159,Study of Biological Markers in Children With Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04839159,UNKNOWN,"Sickle cell disease is associated with significant morbi-mortality hence the interest in an early and targeted care. At present, there is no plasmatic marker able to identify infants at higher risk of developping severe complications later in life. However, recent studies have demonstrated a correlation between certain complications of the disease and biomarkers of the endothelial dysfunction characterizing it.

Investigators prospectively followed a cohort of children diagnosed with SCD through the universal neonatal screening using inflammatory and haemostatic plasmatic markers to study their annual evolution. Investigators then will evaluate potential associations between these biological markers and the occurrence of SCD related complications. A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the repercussions of therapeutic intervention on these markers.

NCT03708731,Exploring Adherence Monitoring in Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03708731,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Despite the well-documented benefits of hydroxyurea (HU) therapy in decreasing morbidity and mortality in youth with Sickle cell disease (SCD), pediatric HU adherence rates range as low as 49% and lead to discontinuation of HU regimens in 8-20%. In addition, treatment non-adherence may lead to unnecessary increases in medication dosage resulting from erroneous assumption that a patient is non-responsive to treatment (versus non-adherent to the regimen as prescribed). Given the detrimental effects of non-adherence, assessment of and intervention for HU non-adherence is essential to improving health outcomes in the pediatric SCD population.

Electronic adherence monitoring is widely considered the ""gold standard"" in objective adherence measurement. These monitors provide continuous, real- time records of medication adherence and reveal problematic behavior patterns, including underdosing, overdosing, delayed dosing, ""drug holidays,"" and ""white coat"" adherence. Overall, electronic adherence measures are considered valid, reliable, and accurate, with clear advantages over pharmacy refill records, physician estimates and self-report measures.

The primary purpose of this pilot study is to determine the use of the AdhereTech as a feasible and valid measure of HU adherence in pediatric SCD.

NCT03226691,Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Collection for Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03226691,COMPLETED,"The constitution of blood relies upon hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which stay in the bone marrow and differentiate to all lineages of peripheral blood cells. HSC transplantation is the only curative option currently available for sickle cell disease (SCD) patients either via allogeneic HSC transplantation or HSC-targeted gene therapy. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)- mobilized HSCs are frequently utilized in the adult setting of HSC transplantation because of the faster hematologic recovery as compared to bone marrow. As an autologous HSC source for gene therapy, bone marrow harvest has been generally employed since G-CSF has been prohibitive in SCD patients due to granulocyte stimulation and the associated reports of vaso-occlusive crises, multi-organ failure, and death. However, when bone marrow harvest is used, the amounts of collected cells are limited and anesthesia is required. In order to obtain HSCs in large numbers without anesthesia, patients will undergo mobilization followed by large volume apheresis. Plerixafor is an alternative treatment for mobilization without direct stimulation to granulocytes, and it is theoretically applicable for SCD patients. The primary endpoint of this study is to obtain sufficient amounts of HSCs collected from the peripheral blood in SCD patients after plerixafor

NCT04877054,Pilot Evaluation of a Motivational Interviewing Intervention Targeting Adherence Behaviors in Youth With Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04877054,COMPLETED,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited blood disorders affecting 100,000 individuals in the United States. SCD often leads to complications, including pain crises and organ damage. Many individuals with SCD require medications (e.g., Hydroxyurea or Endari) that research has demonstrated reduce risk of complications and improve quality of life. Despite the need for strong medication adherence, adolescents and young adults (AYAs; 13-25 years) have the lowest adherence rates compared to other age groups. Efforts to reduce AYA non-adherence risk should include youth in earlier childhood and persist throughout the AYA developmental period, with the goal of maintaining adherence throughout childhood and young adulthood. Motivational Interviewing (MI) has been effective in increasing pediatric and adult medication adherence via in-person or telehealth delivery; however, researchers have yet to empirically evaluate MI for feasibility, acceptability, and/or efficacy in improving pediatric/AYA SCD medication adherence. The proposed feasibility trial will provide preliminary feasibility data for a newly developed MI+education intervention targeting medication adherence for pediatric and adolescents and young adults (AYA) patients who have sickle cell disease. This trial will also evaluate study design feasibility to inform a future randomized controlled trial (RCT). The investigators are interested in delivering the intervention to AYA patients and to parents of younger children who have sickle cell disease because the investigators anticipate that establishing strong adherence in younger childhood could prevent future non-adherence during the AYA developmental period. Participants will include 13-22 year-old patients with sickle cell disease as well as parents of 0-22 year-old patients with sickle cell disease. The investigators will randomize ten families to a 4-session telehealth MI+education intervention and five families to a one-session education-only control condition. All participants will complete assessments at three times. Intervention participants will complete the T2 assessment at their last intervention session (week 4-8), and the T3 assessment 16-20 weeks after study enrollment.

NCT05905770,Do Alemtuzumab Levels Predict T Cell Chimerism After MSD SCT for SCD?,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05905770,RECRUITING,"Rationale: Non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) has become a feasible curative treatment option for sickle cell disease (SCD) patients with an available matched sibling donor. Chemotherapy free conditioning with alemtuzumab and 3 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) is increasingly being used as preferred conditioning scheme for these patients. This regimen typically results in mixed donor chimerism and has only few toxic effects. However, the risk of graft failure (rejection) is still significant, with an occurrence of 13% in the latest series. Levels of T cell chimerism are crucial for the success of this kind of transplantation. A donor T cell level of at least 50% at 1-year post-transplantation seems to be sufficient to allow the discontinuation of immunosuppressive medication without risk of graft rejection. Low levels of alemtuzumab prior to or shortly after SCT are thought to facilitate rejection of the donor graft. Recently, a positive correlation between alemtuzumab levels on day+14 was found with levels of T cell chimerism +2 and +4 months post-transplantation in adult SCD patients receiving matched sibling donor SCT. However, in this study alemtuzumab levels prior to the infusion of hematopoietic stem cells and beyond day +28 post-transplantation were not measured. Furthermore, the alemtuzumab levels were measured in 2 patient groups undergoing two different conditioning regimens.

Here, the investigators aim to thoroughly investigate the correlation of alemtuzumab levels and T cell chimerism. This will be the first study involving SCD patients receiving matched sibling donor SCT with alemtuzumab/TBI conditioning that includes alemtuzumab level measurements before the infusion of hematopoietic stem cells and beyond 1-month post-transplantation. Findings from this study will improve the insights into the etiology of graft failure in these patients and might ultimately lead to a more personalized approach in dosing alemtuzumab in order to achieve a more robust and stable engraftment of donor hematopoietic stem cells.

Objectives: To investigate whether serum alemtuzumab concentrations are predictive of the robustness of engraftment in SCD patients undergoing a matched sibling donor transplantation with alemtuzumab/TBI conditioning resulting in mixed chimerism.

Study design: Prospective observational laboratory study. Serum alemtuzumab concentration will be measured at various time points before and after stem cell infusion (days -3, 0, +7, +14, +28, +60).

Study population: Adult SCD patients that are planned for a matched sibling donor transplantation with alemtuzumab/TBI conditioning at the Amsterdam UMC.

Main study parameters/endpoints: The correlation between serum alemtuzumab concentration and levels of donor chimerism.

It is caused by an autosomal recessive mutation of the β-globin gene, responsible for an abnormal hemoglobin, the main protein in red blood cells, responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. The abnormal hemoglobin, known as ""Sickle"" or S, deforms the red blood cell, causing chronic hemolytic anemia, organ damage (heart, spleen, etc.) and vaso-occlusive crises. Therapeutic progress and specialised patient follow-up have considerably improved the vital and functional prognosis of children and adolescents with sickle cell disease. Physical fitness, measured during a cardiorespiratory exercise test (CPET), is used to determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). Patients with sickle cell disease have a multifactorial limitation of exercise tolerance, which may affect their physical fitness. Authors have shown that VO2max is impaired in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease, independently of their baseline hemoglobin level. Yet VO2max is a key determinant of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients being monitored for a chronic disease. In the past, our team has contributed to the assessment of HRQoL in several groups of pediatric patients suffering from chronic disease (congenital heart disease, PAH). To date, the link between impaired physical fitness and HRQoL has not been demonstrated in sickle cell children.

NCT06563440,Development and Evaluation of an Information Management System and Communication System for Population-wide Point-of-care Infant Sickle Cell Disease Screening,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06563440,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Although over 75% of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are born in sub-Sahara where the disease highly contributes to under-5 mortality and causes life-long debilitation, evidence-based strategies to control SCD are not widely implemented in this region. Early detection of SCD by universal infant screening is a pillar of SCD control. Despite the affordability and move to adopt point-of-care (POC) SCD screening assays in sub-Sahara Africa, the absence of screening information management and communication systems (SIMCS) impedes standardized, systematic, coordinated, nationwide SCD screening programs. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop a SCD SIMCS that will enable universal SCD screening in the sub-Sahara African setting. The objective is to test and optimize a custom SCD SIMCS app and digital network to facilitate SCD screening and then evaluate its impact on access to SCD screening and care and on clinical outcomes of children with SCD in Uganda. The central hypothesis is that the SCD SIMCS will facilitate accurate and coordinated POC SCD screening that is accessible at health centers in urban and rural Uganda. The rationale is to build a custom SCD SIMCS on existing nationwide digital and health infrastructure in Uganda to standardize use of affordable POC assays at health centers nationwide. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Develop and evaluate a four-module ≥3G cell phone app for a novel SCD SIMCS (R21 Phase); 2) Evaluate the impact of the SCD SIMCS on access to screening and care and outcomes of children with SCD (R33 Phase). The investigators will pursue these aims using an innovative combination of software design and re-organization of SCD screening workflows. These include assembly of off-the-shelf software that is compatible with iOS and Android operating systems to reliably, accurately, and handily capture, interpret, transmit, and retrieve/playback information for patient's IDs, test results, salient clinical events, and education. The novel screening workflows are expected to dramatically reduce the cost and increase access to SCD screening and care. The proposed research is significant, because it will determine how to use POC SCD screening assays on a large nationwide scale. It will also enable coordination of evidence-based care and continuity of care between primary and specialist providers and longitudinally over the patient's lifetime - a critical aspect in controlling this life-long disease. The SCD SIMCS will also facilitate real time data management for research and policy for SCD control. The expected immediate outcome of this research is a SCD SIMCS that optimally functions on the digital and health infrastructure in Uganda and demonstration of its impact on access to SCD screening and care and on clinical outcomes of children with SCD. The expected long-term outcome is that the SCD SIMCS will be adopted, integrated, and scaled-up in the health systems of Uganda and other sub-Sahara Africa countries, particularly those where the POC assays have already been adopted as the national standard of SCD screening. If effective, the SCD SIMCS will have an important positive impact because it will reduce the cost of SCD screening, take screening services and evidence-based care closer to rural communities where the majority of children in sub-Sahara Africa live, and, ultimately, save millions of children from preventable and disability death.",NO,Sickle Cell Disease,OTHER: Digital app and information system,"Access to sickle cell disease screening and care, Proportion of infants with sickle cell disease seen at health center within one month of diagnosis, One month from screening for sickle cell disease|Access to evidence-based care for sickle cell disease, Proportion of children under five that are diagnosed with sickle cell disease and receiving penicillin prophylaxis, One year from diagnosis of sickle cell disease|Impact of a coordinated screening and treatment program, Adjusted mortality rate for children with sickle cell disease, Two years from diagnosis of sickle cell disease","Cost of sickle cell disease screening, Financial cost per child screened, Two years|Access to evidence-based care for sickle cell disease, Proportion of children with sickle cell disease on hydroxyurea therapy, Two years from diagnosis of sickle cell disease|Impact of a coordinated screening and treatment program, Prevalence of complications of sickle cell disease including erythrocyte transfusion, sepsis, stroke, and growth delay, Two years",,Makerere University,"Baylor College of Medicine|Ministry of Health, Uganda",ALL,CHILD,NA,24000,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,2024-08-21,2027-07-31,2028-07-31,"Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, 256, Uganda",

Using a stepped-wedge design, The investigators will test two innovative interventions utilizing mobile health to address both patients' and providers' needs: 1) an mHealth application for patients (InCharge Health app) that includes multi-component features to address the memory, motivation, and knowledge barriers to hydroxyurea use, and 2) an mHealth toolbox application for providers (HU Toolbox app) that addresses clinical knowledge barriers in prescribing and monitoring hydroxyurea use. These two interventions will be tested through the following aims:

Aim 1. Improve Patient Adherence to Hydroxyurea: Addressing Memory, Motivation, and Knowledge Barriers to Hydroxyurea Use. Primary hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that among adolescents and adults with SCD, the adherence to hydroxyurea, as measured by percentage of days covered (PDC), will increase by at least 20% at 24 weeks after receiving the InCharge Health app, compared to their hydroxyurea adherence at baseline.

Sub-aim 1.a. To examine and assess both patient engagement and behaviors related to use of the InCharge Health app, the investigators will evaluate consistent use of the app among enrolled patients, patient satisfaction, and continued use of the app beyond the study period.

Sub-Aim 1.b. To examine the clinical influence of the use of the InCharge Health app on PDC, patients' clinical outcomes, perceived health literacy, health related quality of life, and perceived self-efficacy between baseline and 24 weeks.

Aim 2. Improve Provider Hydroxyurea Awareness, Prescribing and Monitoring Behaviors.

Sub-Aim 2.a. To examine and assess provider engagement and behaviors related to use of the HU Toolbox, the investigators will evaluate consistent use of the app among enrolled providers, providers' satisfaction, and continued use of the app beyond the study period.

Sub-Aim 2.b. To assess the combined effects of the patient and provider mHealth interventions on hydroxyurea and health care utilization, the investigators will examine if the changes in hydroxyurea adherence are enhanced by the use of both provider and patient interventions compared to those not exposed to one or both interventions.

Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) causes blood cells form a crescent shape. It is caused by a genetic mutation in the hemoglobin gene. People with SCD are at increased risk for illnesses like stroke, chronic pain, and heart problems, as well as decreased overall health and well-being. Researchers want to learn more about how nutrition and diet can help relieve or reduce the symptoms of SCD.

Objective:

To understand how diet, dietary patterns and behaviors, nutrition, and other related factors in adults with SCD affect their overall health.

Eligibility:

Adults aged 18 and older with SCD.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records. They will take a pregnancy test if needed.

Participants will have a physical exam and medical history. Their height, weight, and waist and hip circumference will be measured. They can complete this exam (1) via telehealth along with a visit to an outpatient laboratory center or (2) by going to the NIH Clinical Center.

Participants will complete 2 interviews about their diet. They will talk about the foods they ate in the past 24 hours. They will also complete 1 interview about diet-related behaviors such as food shopping and cooking. They can complete the interviews in person, by phone, or by telehealth visit.

NCT03709303,"Motivations, Expectations, and Decision-making of Sickle Cell Patients in Clinical Research",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03709303,COMPLETED,"Background:

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder. People with this disease have a problem with their hemoglobin. That is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen in the body. Some people with this disease are enrolled in research at NIH. Researchers want to learn more about the thoughts and opinions of those people. This may improve the way researchers explain clinical studies, risks, and benefits to people with the disease.

Objective:

To learn about the motivations, decisions, and experiences in clinical research of people with sickle cell disease.

Eligibility:

Adults ages 18 and older who have sickle cell disease. They must be in an NIH study on this condition. They must have been invited to join either a gene therapy or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation study.

Design:

Participants will have 1 interview. It will be done in a quiet room in the NIH Clinical Center or by video call. It will take about 60 minutes.

The interview will be audio-recorded if the participant agrees.

Participants will be asked about:

* Their experiences with and thoughts on sickle cell disease
* Their decision to participate in clinical research
* Factors that may have affected their decision to participate. These may include family, disease history, or faith.

To study the safety and efficacy of deferasirox as treatment of oxidative stress in adult subjects with sickle cell disease.

Endpoints:

The investigators will determine whether treatment with iron chelators results in decreased sickling of RBCs, oxidative stress, neutrophil activation, inflammation, endothelial activation and hypercoagulability and ultimately reduced disease severity. If the hypothesis is confirmed in this pilot dose-finding study, a larger randomized controlled clinical trial will be initiated.

Study design:

This will be an open-label pilot study, including 12 patients per dose group with a maximum of 3 dose groups. As the antioxidant capacity of deferasirox might be dose-dependent, the investigators will start with the highest dose of deferasirox (360 mg) deemed adequate for chronic use without causing iron depletion in adult SCD patients.

This study proposes to monitor SCD and its treatment through their impact on cerebral hemodynamics, as the brain is one of the most vulnerable and consequential targets of the disease. Specifically, this study will optimize quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and advanced optical spectroscopy techniques such as frequency-domain near-infrared and diffuse correlation spectroscopies (FDNIRS-DCS) to monitor 1) cerebral oxygen transport with measures of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) and 2) endothelial function with cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR).

Additionally, this study aims to monitor baseline cerebral oxygen transport and CVR, as well as changes that occur with treatment (transfusion or genetic therapy to induce fetal hemoglobin) and assess hemoglobinopathy patients with known genotypes and phenotypes.

NCT03007849,A Pilot Study of Fecal Microbiome and Neutrophil Cellular Adhesion Molecules in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease (SCD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03007849,UNKNOWN,"Patients with sickle cell disease often develop painful crisis without any obvious reasons. Some patients are more likely to develop this complication than others. It is now clear that painful crisis only occurs when sickled red blood cells stick to white blood cells that have been activated, usually by inflammation or infections. A recent study in mice with sickle cell disease showed that the use of long term antibiotics could reduce the number of activated white blood cells and reduce death of the mice during sickle cell crisis.

The investigators believe that sickle cell patients who develop frequent painful crisis may have a different pattern of bacteria in their intestine when compared to those whose painful crisis occurs infrequently. In this study, the investigators propose to study sickle cell subject's blood to determine how many activated white blood cells he/she have. The investigators will also examine his/her stool to compare the bacteria in his/her stool to those other sickle cell patients. The investigators will then investigate whether or not the results from the blood and stool tests correlate with how frequently the patient develops painful crisis.

The investigators will examine the patients' medical records to find out how many times they have been admitted to the hospital for sickle cell crisis in the last 12 months. The investigators will also obtain information on the following: their age, their sex, whether they are taking hydroxyurea or Penicillin, when they last had a transfusion or exchange transfusion therapy and painful crisis needing hospital admission, whether they have received any antibiotics (other than Penicillin) in the last 4 weeks, and whether they are experiencing a painful crisis at the time that they enter the study. The investigators will obtain, from their previous laboratory results, their levels of hemoglobin F and markers of inflammation. The investigators will check their hemoglobin F level if they have not already had this tested.

However, the consequences of these muscle alterations on the functional status of muscles are unknown. In addition, whether the poor physical fitness of sickle cell patients can be attributed, at least partly, to an hypothetical muscle dysfunction has never been tested.

Purpose : this study will compare the muscle function of legs between sickle cell patients (SS and SC genotypes) and healthy individuals (AA genotype) before, during and after a short localized muscle endurance exercise.

Abstract : Very recently, a study reported large differences between the muscle microcirculation networks of sickle cell patients compared to healthy individuals with decreased capillary density and higher proportion of large capillaries in the former population. In addition, the same study showed signs of amyotrophy in sickle cell patients. However, the muscle function of sickle cell patients has not been investigated and one may suggest that muscle dysfunction could participate in the decrease of physical fitness, in association with the hematological and hemorheological disorders, already reported in this population. The hypothesis is that muscle fatigue during a short localized muscle endurance exercise should be higher in sickle cell patients compared to healthy individuals, due to a greater recruitment of glycolytic fibers and a faster decrease of muscle oxygenation during exercise.",NO,Sickle Cell Disease,BIOLOGICAL: Blood sampling|OTHER: Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) test force|OTHER: Localized muscle endurance test|OTHER: Self-paced six-minute walk test,"Maximum isometric muscular strength, Isometric muscular strength will be determined by Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) test force on dominant leg.

NCT03786549,Pediatric -Adult Care Transition Program of Patients With Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03786549,RECRUITING,"Background The pediatric-adult care transition is a risk-disrupting time for patients with chronic disease. This care transition takes place during adolescence; a period of psychological upheavals and adaptations of family roles. During this period, medication adherence is non-optimal and absenteeism at medical appointments is high.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the first genetic disease detected in France. It is chronic disease characterized by frequent painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) requiring emergency hospitalization when they are severe. Other serious complications are acute chest syndromes (ACS) and stroke.

In order to improve the health status of teenagers with sickle cell disease, it is necessary to anticipate this care transition and to involve the pediatric and adult sectors. The biopsychosocial health approach and the Social-Ecological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult Readiness to Transition (SMART) describe a care transition integrating bioclinical and psychosocial factors such as integration of the patient's family, education on disease and therapeutics, psychological management of pain and medico-social orientation.

The pediatric-adult transition program proposed is based on this biopsychosocial approach. It aims to improve the health status of adolescents with SCD, their quality of life and the use of health care service.

Objective of the study To assess the impact of a pediatric-adult transition program on the incidence of sickle-cell-related complications leading to hospitalization on 24-months after transfer to the adult sector.

The evaluation focuses on severe complications leading to hospitalization, such as VOC, ACS, and stroke.

Study design Multicenter Open-label individual Randomized Controlled Trial Population : Patients aged at least 16 years old with sickle cell disease, and their parents (or legal representatives Number of subject : 196 patients (98 patients by arm) The study will last 24 months Expected results For patients and families Better health and quality of life for patients is expected, including better use of medical care after the transition program. It is also expected a better experience of the pediatric-adult care transition and indirectly a better experience of intrafamilial relations.

For health professionals This project is expected to provide solutions to improve the pediatric-adult care transition of patients with chronic disease. Indeed, the methodological quality of the study will make it possible to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed program, to possibly adapt it and test it to other chronic diseases presenting the same care transition problematic.

In terms of public health SCD mainly affects populations of sub-Saharan origin, with low visibility and high social vulnerability. By focusing on this population, this project will reduce the social inequalities in health, experienced by patients with SCD and their families.

NCT05632289,Osteopathic Manipulation in the Management of Pain Associated With Sickel Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05632289,RECRUITING,"Background: Sickle cell disease is the most common monogenic disease in the world caused by a mutation in the β-globin gene which creates abnormal hemoglobin called HbS. This polymer deforms the erythrocyte, making it more fragile and less flexible, thus leading to the occlusion of small blood vessels. This obstruction is the cause of painful vaso-occlusive crises and ischemia-reperfusion phenomena.

Patients with sickle cell disease undergo major acute and chronic pain responsible for a significant deterioration in their quality of life and a significant consumption of analgesics, often daily, sometimes with the development of addictive behavior. Improved analgesic management was associated with improved disease prognosis. Several studies have shown the effectiveness of the osteopathic approach in the management of chronic pain. Our hypothesis is that the association with the standard treatment of osteopathy sessions could improve but also prevent the chronic pain frequent in patients with sickle cell disease.

Objectives: Our main objective is to study the effectiveness of an osteopathic treatment in adult sickle cell patients with chronic pain on the reduction of the consumption of level I and II analgesics at 3 months (D90 +/- 15 days).

Methods/Experimental design: This is a single-blind prospective randomized controlled monocentric study. The study population will be composed of 37 sickle cell patients aged over 18 years. The patients included will be allocated into two groups: one group will receive the osteopathic treatment and the 2nd group will receive the ""placebo"" treatment. Analgesic consumption will be assessed by weekly self- questionnaire. The evaluation of the pain will be carried out by the visual analogue scale (VAS). The degree of stress will be measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Patients will receive an osteopathic treatment or a ""placebo"" treatment, one session every 4 weeks for 12 weeks with a total of 3 sessions per patient. The duration of each session is 45 minutes. Pain and stress assessments will be done before each session. A final evaluation will be carried out 3 months after the end of the osteopathic or ""placebo"" treatment. Data analysis will be performed using SPSS version 17.0 software. The significance threshold will be set at 0.05. This is the first protocol that aims to evaluate, with scientific rigor, the impact of the osteopathic approach in the management of pain in patients with sickle cell disease.",NO,Sickle Cell Disease,OTHER: osteopathic manipulative therapy|OTHER: sham osteopathic manipulative therapy,"The consumption of nonopioid and weak opioid analgesics, Analgesic consumption will be assessed by weekly self-questionnaire, 3 month","pain assessement, Pain assessment will be performed using the Visual Analog Scale score.

Gene therapy is a relatively new field of medicine in which genetic material (mostly DNA) in the patient is changed to treat his or her own disease. In gene therapy, we introduce new genetic material in order to fix or replace the patient's disease gene, with the goal of curing the disease. The procedure is similar to a bone marrow transplant, in that the patient's malfunctioning blood stem cells are reduced or eliminated using chemotherapy, but it is different because instead of using a different person's (donor) blood stem cells for the transplant, the patient's own blood stem cells are given back after the new genetic material has been introduced into those cells. This approach has the advantage of eliminating any risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD), reducing the risk of graft rejection, and may also allow less chemotherapy to be utilized for the conditioning portion of the transplant procedure. To introduce new genetic material into the patient's own blood stem cells we use a modified version of a virus (called a 'vector') that efficiently inserts the ""correcting"" genetic material into the cells. The vector is a specialized biological medicine that has been formulated for use in human beings.

Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is a healthy, non-sickling kind of hemoglobin. The investigators have discovered a gene that is very important in controlling the amount of HbF. Decreasing the expression of this gene in sickle cell patients could increase the amount of fetal hemoglobin while simultaneously reducing the amount of sickle hemoglobin in their blood, specifically the amount in red blood cells where sickle hemoglobin causes damage to the cell, and therefore potentially cure or significantly improve the condition. The gene we are targeting for change in this study that controls the level of fetal hemoglobin is called BCL11A.

In summary, the advantages of a gene therapy approach include: 1) it can be used even if the patient does not have a matched donor available; 2) it may allow a reduction in the amount of chemotherapy required to prepare the patient for the transplant; and 3) it will avoid certain strong medicines often required to prevent and treat GVHD and rejection. Our lab studies with normal mice, mice that have a form of SCD, and with cells from the bone marrow of SCD patients who have donated bone marrow for research purposes show this approach is very effective in reducing the amount of sickle hemoglobin in red cells. Our pilot trial testing this approach in 10 patients with SCD has shown that the treatment has not caused any unexpected safety problems, and that it increases HbF within the red blood cells. Our goal is to continue to test whether this approach is safe, and whether using gene therapy to change the expression of BCL11A will lead to decreased episodes of vaso-occlusive crisis pain in people with SCD.",NO,Sickle Cell Disease,BIOLOGICAL: Autologous CD34+ HSC cells transduced with the lentiviral vector containing a shRNA targeting BCL11a,"Occurrence of VOEs by Month 24 post-infusion, Each patient will be classified as either a success or a failure (binary endpoint).

Each serves a large population with SCD, uses EPIC as their electronic health record, and has a Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA), which will help speed the translation of discovery into improved patient care. During the UH3 Implementation Phase, the 3-arm, 3-site randomized controlled trial will follow a quantitative modified SMART design, a pragmatic trial that evaluates adaptive interventions where the guided relaxation and acupuncture interventions respond to patients' characteristics and evolving pain status. The investigators rely on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to plan, execute, and evaluate associated implementation processes. The use of complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies by those with SCD to reduce pain and opioid use, to help enable them to better cope with their pain, is well known, but there are few studies that evaluate the effectiveness of these therapies, and none that also evaluates the implementation across multiple health care systems and patient populations as this study will.

Aim 1: Determine the effectiveness of guided relaxation and acupuncture as compared to usual care in decreasing pain and opioid use for SCD patients. Hypothesis: At 6-weeks, SCD patients randomized to either CIH intervention will have a greater decrease in pain, opioid use, sleep, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and pain catastrophizing compared to SCD patients randomized to usual care.

Aim 2: Identify the best adaptive intervention for improved outcomes by documenting outcomes among adaptive intervention sequences: (1) initiate guided relaxation and switch to acupuncture for non-responders at midpoint; (2) initiate guided relaxation and continue with guided relaxation for non-responders at midpoint; (3) initiate acupuncture and switch to guided relaxation for non-responders at midpoint or (4) initiate acupuncture and continue with acupuncture for non-responders at midpoint.

Aim 3: Explore differences in response to the adaptive interventions by age and sex.

Aim 4: Identify implementation facilitators, challenges, and solutions for structures and processes that contribute to the seamless integration of CIH therapies into the 3 health systems by conducting individual interviews with participants in the intervention group who responded to the intervention and those who did not.

The most expressive and most frequent complication of the disease is vaso-occlusive crisis, dominated by a painful syndrome. In addition to vaso-occlusive crises, many more chronic biological disturbances are observed in sickle cell patients.Sickle cell disease is considered nowadays as a hypercoagulable state.

However, the approach used so far to the measure of clotting in sickle cell disease was segmented in the sense that the various components of the hemostatic balance were studied separately.The thrombin generation test is a functional test which explores the coagulation globally, integrating both pro players that anticoagulants actors in the system.

NCT03282656,Gene Transfer for Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03282656,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"A promising approach for the treatment of genetic diseases is called gene therapy. Gene therapy is a relatively new field of medicine that uses genetic material (mostly DNA) from the patient to treat his or her own disease. In gene therapy, the investigators introduce new genetic material in order to fix or replace the patient's disease gene, with the goal of curing the disease. The procedure is similar to a bone marrow transplant, in that the patient's malfunctioning blood stem cells are reduced or eliminated using chemotherapy, but it is different because instead of using a different person's (donor) blood stem cells for the transplant, the patient's own blood stem cells are given back after the new genetic material has been introduced into those cells. This approach has the advantage of eliminating any risk of GVHD, reducing the risk of graft rejection, and may also allow less chemotherapy to be utilized for the conditioning portion of the transplant procedure. The method used to introduce the gene into the patient's own blood stem cells is to engineer and use a modified version of a virus (called a 'vector') that efficiently inserts the ""correcting"" genetic material into the cells. The vector is a specialized biological medicine that has been formulated for use in human beings.

The investigators have recently discovered a gene that is very important in the control of fetal hemoglobin expression. Increasing the expression of this gene in sickle cell patients could increase the amount of fetal hemoglobin while simultaneously reducing the amount of sickle hemoglobin in their blood, and therefore potentially cure the condition. In summary, the advantages of a gene therapy approach include: 1) it can be used even if the patient does not have a matched donor available; 2) it may allow a reduction in the amount of chemotherapy required to prepare the patient for the transplant; and 3) it will avoid the strong medicines often required to prevent and treat GVHD and rejection. The goal is to test whether this approach is safe, and whether using gene therapy to change the expression of this particular gene will lead to increased fetal hemoglobin production in people with sickle cell disease.",NO,Sickle Cell Disease,BIOLOGICAL: single infusion of autologous bone marrow derived CD34+ HSC cells transduced with the lentiviral vector containing a short-hairpin RNA targeting BCL11a,"Rescue of hematopoiesis after conditioning, Rescue of hematopoiesis after conditioning (defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 0.5 x 109 /L for three consecutive days), achieved within 7 weeks following infusion (i.e., ""primary engraftment"")., within 7 weeks following infusion of gene transfer product","Expression of transgene, a.

Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation procedures are used for people with sickle cell disease. Researchers want to improve the success and reduce the complications for these procedures. This might allow more people to have a transplant.

Objective:

To see if a new transplant regime is effective, safe and well tolerated in people with sickle cell disease.

Eligibility:

Adults at least 18 years old with sickle cell disease and certain complications.

A relative who is a half tissue match.

Design:

Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. Recipients will also have:

* Heart, lung, and mental health tests
* Chest x-rays
* Bone marrow taken from the pelvic bone
* Eyes and teeth checked

Recipients will have a large central line inserted into a vein for up to 6 months.

Donors will have their veins tested and have an IV inserted for 1 day or on rare occasions 2 days.

Donors will get a drug to activate bone marrow. It will be injected for about 6 days.

Donors will have at least 1 five-hour procedure where bone marrow stem cells will be collected. Blood will be taken from a vein in one arm or in rare cases from a groin vein and put through a machine. Some blood will be saved and the rest will be returned. Stem cells will be taken from the saved blood in a lab and frozen until ready to give to the recipient.

Recipients will have:

* Stems cells collected and frozen
* Hygiene lessons
* Bone density scans
* Low-dose radiation
* Drugs for their immune system
* Donor cells infused through their central line

The sickle cell disease registry of the Society for Paediatric Oncology/Haematology aims at describing the epidemiology of sickle cell disease in German-speaking central Europe. Patients with sickle cell disease will be characterized clinically and genetically and treatment will be documented with the aim to find predictors of the course of disease.

In addition, the registry results should provide a solid evidence base to incorporate sickle cell disease into routine newborn screening and to update the national guidelines for the management of patients suffering from sickle cell disease in Germany.

A consortium of five university hospitals (Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Heidelberg, Ulm) has been mandated by the Society for Paediatric Oncology/Haematology to implement this registry.

The number of participating centers is constantly increasing and new centers that take care of either pediatric or adult patients with sickle cell disease are encouraged to support the registry.

NCT01602809,Microvessels and Heart Problems in Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01602809,COMPLETED,"Background:

- Small blood vessels (microvessels) in many different organs are affected by diseases such as diabetes and atherosclerosis. These microvessels may also be abnormal in people who have sickle cell disease. Stiffness of the red blood cells leads to problems in the microvessels of the heart and kidneys. However, these problems may not be detected until these organs are severely affected. Researchers want to study problems with microvessels in people with and without sickle cell disease.

Objectives:

- To study how microvessels in the heart and other organs are affected by sickle cell disease.

Eligibility:

* Individuals at least 18 years of age who have sickle cell disease.
* Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected.
* All participants will have about 3 to 4 hours of testing for the study. Participants with sickle cell disease who are having a pain crisis at the time they enter the study may be asked to have the testing again when the crisis is over. The repeat testing will occur at least 4 weeks after the pain crisis ends.
* All participants will have the following tests:
* Blood draws to check kidney and liver function, and other blood tests
* Measure of blood flow in the brachial (upper arm) artery
* Heart ultrasound
* Ultrasound scans of arm muscles to study blood flow
* Ultrasound scans after taking vasodilators to increase blood flow

NCT03977532,Study of a Red Blood Cell Deformability Parameter in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03977532,COMPLETED,"Sickle cell disease is the most common genetic disease in the world. It results in the synthesis of an abnormal hemoglobin (HbS) which, in its deoxygenated form, polymerizes and causes structural changes in red blood cells (RBCs). They become more rigid and less deformable. The fragility of sickle-cell RBCs leads to their massive destruction, leading to chronic anemia (i.e. low hemoglobin in the blood) and to low tissue oxygenation. More rigid and less deformable, sickle-shaped RBCs tend to obstruct microvessels, leading to particularly painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), which can cause organ failure (spleen, kidneys, brain, lungs, heart, liver, bone ...) and patient's lifethreatning. A preliminary work on red blood cells of sickle cell patients showed alteration of a parameter measuring the overall deformability of RBCs by assessing the nature of their movement in a shear flow. This parameter is altered sickle cell patients at basal state compared to a population of healthy individuals. This alteration is increased when sickle cell patients are in crisis.

The main objective of this project is to study the evolution of this parameter in sickle cell patients according to their health status (basal state vs vaso-occlusive crisis). The investigators hypothesize that the alteration of the RBC deformability parameter is significant before symptoms of vaso-occlusive crisis (several hours to several days). The main objective is a weekly analysis of the evolution of the parameter in 30 sickle cell patients (SS or SB°) in the basal state and daily in at least 6 patients at the beginning, during and just after a vaso-occlusive crisis. The comparison between the parameter measured in a subject in the basal state and in the same subject in crisis will be performed. The criteria for the presence of a vaso-occlusive crisis were: the appearance of a attacks of pain affecting at least two territories +/- fever\> 38.3 +/- dyspnea and / or sputum. The investigators will differentiate the moderate VOC managed at home with low-level analgesics and VOC requiring hospitalization. The number of days of hospitalization, the occurrence of thrombotic complications, the degree of anemia and hemolysis will be noted. The measurement of the parameter will be performed on a capillary sampling of 40 microliters performed at the fingertip, weekly outside crises and daily when a crisis occurs.",NO,Sickle Cell Disease,OTHER: Micro-blood sampling,"cytoplasmic viscosity measurement of red blood cells, Determination of the cytoplasmic viscosity parameter variations by measuring percentage of tanktreading (nature of movement of cells in a shear flow) from a micro-blood sample, 6 months",,,Assistance Publique Hopitaux De Marseille,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,21,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: OTHER,2018-09-14,2019-12-11,2023-08-03,"Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Marseille, Marseille, 13005, France",

Americans living with SCD suffer recurrent episodes of acute and chronic pain, both of which are exacerbated by stress. Building on the successes of our prior formative studies, we now propose a well-designed, appropriately powered study to test efficacy of YCWS on outcomes (pain intensity, stress intensity, opioid use) in adults with SCD. We propose to recruit 170 adults for a randomized controlled trial of the short-term (8 weeks) and long-term (6 months) effects of YCWS on outcomes (pain, stress, and opioid use). Stratified on worst pain intensity (\<=5; \>5), we will randomly assign patients to groups: 85 to Control (Self-monitoring of outcomes + alerts/reminders), and 85 to Experimental (Self-monitoring of outcomes + alerts/reminders + use of YCWS \[RDE + Support\]). We will ask participants to report outcomes daily. During weeks 1-8, we will send system-generated alerts/reminders to both groups via phone call, text, or email to facilitate data entry (both groups) and intervention use support (experimental). If the patient does not enter data after 24 hours, study support staff will contact him/her for data entry trouble-shooting (both groups) and YCWS use (experimental). We will time stamp and track participants' online activities to understand the study context and conduct exit interviews on acceptability of the staff and system-generated support.

Silent and overt strokes contribute significantly to morbidity in adults with SCD, resulting in functional impairment, challenges with school and job performance, and premature death. Five NIH-funded randomized controlled trials have identified therapies to prevent silent and overt strokes in children with SCD, including monthly blood transfusion therapy (for preventing initial and recurrent strokes) and hydroxyurea (for preventing initial strokes). Despite the observation that at least 99% of children with SCD in high-income countries reach adulthood, and approximately 60% of adults will experience one or more strokes (\~50% with silent strokes and \~10% with overt strokes), no stroke trials have established therapeutic approaches for adults with SCD. For adults with SCD, inadequate evidence-based guidelines exist for secondary stroke prevention strategies. Applying stroke prevention strategies in children may not be effective for stroke prevention in adults with SCD, particularly given the high rate of co-morbidities. Identifying subgroups of adults with SCD and higher incidence coupled with the contribution of established stroke risk factors in the general population (smoking, diabetes, obesity, renal disease) will provide the requisite data required for the first-ever phase III clinical trials focused on secondary stroke prevention in adults.",NO,"Anemia, Sickle Cell|Sickle Cell Disease|Stroke|Sickle Cell Thalassemia|Sickle Cell-Beta0-Thalassemia",,"Adjudication of silent stroke in those with reported history of silent stroke and hydroxyurea therapy, Based on results of an MRI exam and a neurological exam, performed by a physician, the Neuroradiology Committee and the Neurology Committee will come to consensus on whether a silent stroke has occurred.

NCT04983654,Functional and Mechanistic Characterization of Limb Ulcers in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04983654,COMPLETED,"Sickle Cell Disease is the most frequent genetic disease in the world (representing one birth over 1900, in France). The polymerization of the abnormal hemoglobin (i.e., HbS) when deoxygenated is at the origin of a mechanical distortion of red blood cells (RBC) into a crescent-like shape. Sickled RBCs are very fragile and rigid, which lead patients to have severe anemia and to develop frequent and repeated painful vaso-occlusive crises. Furthermore, the repetition of sickling-unsickling cycles causes irreversible damages to the RBCs, which shorten their half-life. Accumulation of free hemoglobin and heme in the plasma is involved in blood vessels lesions in both the macro- and micro- circulation.

The resulting vascular dysfunction could explain why limb ulcers are 10 fold more frequent in patients with sickle cell disease compared to the general population and may happen at a younger age. Limb ulcers induce significant morbidity (delay of healing between 9 and 26 weeks in the french cohort), and are associated to significant pain (needing opioid pain-killer) and increase the risk of infection. Cost of care is also increased. Moreover, ulcers induce missed school and work days.

Data on cutaneous microcirculation and ulcers physiopathology in patients with sickle cell disease are scarce. We want to realise a microcirculatory and neurological functional study of patients with with and without ulcers and a characterization of biomarkers present in the blood or in the wound fluid which can participate to ulcers physiopathology.

To ensure healing, adapted therapeutics are essential. Several strategies are proposed such as: lifestyle measures (venous compression, lower limb elevation, rest), dressings, hyperbaric oxygenotherapy (also used in diabetic ulcers).

It is composed by two separate study designs: a cross-sectional study and a longitudinal study.

The cross-sectional study will evaluate clinical and laboratory parameters in paediatric Sickle Cell Anaemia (SCA) patients (ages 2-18 years) in steady state and during Vaso-Occlusive Crisis (VOCs) to determine the parameters that can be used as a guide to monitor the course of the disease towards early recognition and management of sickle cell crises. In addition, the study will explore genotype-phenotype correlations in SCA patients by targeted Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) of genetic modifiers for haemoglobinopathies.

The longitudinal study will collect clinical and laboratory data over time for a paediatric cohort of SCD patients (9 months old; followed up to 2 years of age) and parental samples will be collected to determine the βS-globin haplotype in family trios. The aim is to determine the temporal relationships among foetal haemoglobin (HbF) levels, haematological parameters and frequency of sickle cell crises in SCD patients in relation to the type of the βS-globin haplotype and the sickle genotype. In addition, samples collected at 24 months of age will also be analysed by NGS to identify genetic modifiers of clinical manifestations and severity of SCA.

Despite greater longevity in SCD, the period following the transition from pediatric to adult care is critical; youth aged 18-30 years are at high risk for mortality and have high rates of healthcare utilization, leading to high healthcare costs. As such, health care transition (HCT) programs have been created to prepare patients for adult-centered care and subsequently, improve health outcomes. However, very few programs have been evaluated for effectiveness in achieving optimal health outcomes in SCD. This paucity of program evaluation is attributed to a lack of identifiable predictors and outcomes.

NCT04514510,Fixed Dose Flavonoid Isoquercetin on Thrombo-Inflammatory Biomarkers in Subjects With Stable Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04514510,COMPLETED,"Background:

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobin disorder. People with SCD have an increased chance for getting blood clots. Researchers want to see if a dietary supplement called isoquercetin can decrease levels of inflammation and blood clotting in people with SCD.

Objective:

To see how isoquercetin works in people with SCD.

Eligibility:

Adults age 18-70 years old who have SCD and are in a steady-state (have not experienced a pain crisis in the last 60 days and, if taking hydroxyurea, have not had a dose change in the past 90 days).

Design:

Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, medicine review, and blood tests.

Participants will be put in 1 of 2 treatment groups. They will take 4 capsules of isoquercetin or placebo all at once, by mouth, every day for 4 weeks. They will get a pill dispenser and keep a medicine diary.

Participants may have an optional near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) test to measure how treatment affects blood flow. In this test, probes will be placed on the skin to measure tissue oxygen level and blood flow. A blood pressure cuff placed on the arm will be filled with air briefly to restrict the blood flow in the arm (for up to 5 minutes) and then released. Participants may also be asked to breathe at a certain rate or hold their breath for as long as they can during measurements.

Participants will take folic acid once a day.

Participants will have an end-of-study drug visit. They will discuss any side effects and repeat some of the screening tests. They may have an additional optional NIRS test.

About a month after the end of study drug visit, participants will be contacted by phone to see if they have any side effects. Those who do may have a follow-up visit. At this visit, they may have additional blood tests performed.

NCT02394431,Added Value of Speckle Tracking in the Evaluation of Patients With Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02394431,COMPLETED,"Sickle Cell Disease is a serious disease that is life-threatening for patients being homozygous for the SS form or heterozygous for the SC or βthal forms. The CHU Brugmann hospital currently regularly treats about 70 homozygous adult patients and this number is in constant augmentation.

Sickle cell disease patients may develop a cardiomyopathy due to chronic anemia, the haemosiderosis risk or, less frequently, to coronary vaso-occlusive damages.

The hypervolemia in patients with sickle cell disease causes an overestimation of the ejected left ventricular fraction measured by echocardiography, this parameter being very dependent of the blood volume.It has already been shown that the left ventricular ejection fraction was normal in most patients with sickle cell disease, but that its evaluation by parameters independent from the blood volume showed the existence of a dysfunction.

Myocardial strain, as measured by speckle tracking, is a echographic evaluation method of the cardiac function, independent of the blood volume. This technique hasn't been used much in sickle cell disease patients. A study using 3D speckle tracking on a limited number of sickle cell disease patients failed to show a strain anomaly. Moreover, the study highlighted a higher global longitudinal strain in this patient population. The investigators find these data hard to explain and in contradiction with previous studies using other cardiac function evaluation techniques, independent from the blood volume.

The primary goal of this study is thus

* to study the longitudinal strain by 2D echography
* to determine if anomalies of the longitudinal strain exist in sickle cell disease patients with a normal ejected left ventricular fraction, compared to a control group of healthy patients.

NCT05199766,Hemolysis Related Complications in SCD. A Phase II Study With Voxelotor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05199766,RECRUITING,"Intro:

Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation of the β hemoglobin called HbS, which causes red blood cell (RBC) abnormalities responsible for hemolysis, mainly intravascular, leading to chronic anemia. Intravascular hemolysis is responsible for severe inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.

Maintaining hemoglobin in its oxygenated R-conformation is one of the strategies for inhibiting the polymerization of HbS. Previous experimental therapeutic approaches having this effect have been discontinued due to poor pharmaceutical properties or toxicity. Nevertheless, they proved the validity of the concept by demonstrating an increase in oxyhemoglobin and a decrease in biomarkers of hemolysis.

Voxelotor binds to the α chain of globin and maintains Hb in its R conformation, thereby inhibiting the polymerization of HbS while increasing the affinity of Hb for oxygen.

Because of its mechanism of action affecting anemia and hemolysis, Voxelotor is a promising treatment for the prevention and treatment of renal and cerebral arterial disease.

Hypothesis/Objective :

Investigator hypothesis is that the treatment by Voxelotor (GBT440) will improve intra vascular hemolysis and will increase the total mass of hemoglobin with beneficial effects on organ function.

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the biological activity of Voxelotor on the reduction of intra vascular hemolysis measured by plasma hemoglobin.

The secondary objectives of the study will aim at characterizing the effects of GBT 440 Voxelotor on:

* Intra vascular hemolysis measured by plasma Heme
* Total hemoglobin mass (MHb)
* RBCs lifespan
* Blood volumes (plasma volume (PV), red blood cell mass (RBCM), total blood volume (BV))
* Blood viscosity
* Cerebral perfusion
* Cerebrovascular vaso-reactivity
* Cognitive function (MoCA)
* Six minute walk test
* Renal perfusion and iron deposits in renal cortex
* Measurement of Glomerular filtration rate Estimation of glomerular filtration rate (CKD/EPI equation)
* Urine albumin/creatinine ratio
* Ability to decrease or stop erythropoietin in patients under EPO treatment
* Safety (VOC, ACS, Priapism) and tolerability of voxelotor
* RBC properties

Pulmonary complications, namely acute chest syndrome, obstructive lung disease and pulmonary hypertension, are the most common causes of death in patients with SCA. Recent studies suggest that lung specific inflammation is a hallmark of SCA and underlies pulmonary pathology. To date, no therapy has been shown to improve the pulmonary complications of SCA. Macrolides have pleomorphic effects in the lung with improvement in pulmonary function, symptoms and inflammatory markers demonstrated in several inflammatory pulmonary conditions such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, COPD and post-transplant bronchiolitis obliterans.

NCT01242878,MACS Study - Microparticles and Coagulation in Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01242878,UNKNOWN,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder of the red blood cell. It is now the commonest genetic disorder in the UK and of childhood stroke, with up to 40% of children having a stroke (clinical or picked up on a scan) by school age. Patients are prone to develop acute crises necessitating hospital admission and resulting in long-term complications. Such events result in considerable morbidity, disability and mortality with its consequent burden on patients, families, the health service and society as a whole. Doctors have very little ability to predict who will get ill and when and so it is very difficult to known when and how to administer treatments. Furthermore there is very little in the way of treatments available and the mainstay of prevention is a chronic blood transfusion programme which is expensive, requires time off work and school and can be fraught with complications. This, in a population who is frequently educationally and socially disadvantaged at the outset. Recent evidence in sickle cell disease and other diseases that have similar underlying processes, points towards the importance of microparticles (circulating broken pieces of cells) and the coagulation system as being important. By comparing levels of these particles and molecules in patients with those found in healthy volunteers and with other measures known to be important, this study hopes to identify their role so as to improve the management of these patients and potentially to lead the way for new therapies.

NCT03344900,Re-Aiming at Hydroxyurea Adherence for Sickle Cell With mHealth,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03344900,COMPLETED,"National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidelines recommend that hydroxyurea be offered to symptomatic adults and all children with sickle cell disease (SCD) (HbSS and HbSβ0-thal genotypes) age ≥9 months. Research has shown that hydroxyurea reduces hospitalizations and mortality, supporting its effectiveness outside of clinical trials. Hydroxyurea is given as a once-daily oral dose that costs \<$1 per day. Despite overwhelming evidence for positive effects, hydroxyurea is vastly underutilized. Given the relative ease of its administration, low cost, and safety profile, barriers to hydroxyurea utilization are primarily constrained to the health system and patient determinants. System-level barriers include insufficient access to SCD-specific care, limited access to medication (due to lack of health coverage), and providers' reluctance in prescribing it; while patient-level barriers include low acceptance (due to insufficient knowledge or misconceptions regarding risks and benefits), and forgetfulness leading to poor adherence.

Mobile health (mHealth) refers to the practice of medicine and public health supported by mobile devices. Short message service (SMS) text messaging (through cell phones) is a widespread means of communication, particularly among adolescents and young adults and is an emerging intervention modality to improve medication adherence. Its low cost, simplicity, and prevalence allow for relatively easy adoption and dissemination in medical practices.

This protocol seeks to examine barriers to hydroxyurea adherence among SCD patients between 15 and 45 years of age who are living in the Memphis region by conducting a needs assessment. In addition to examining these barriers, the needs assessment will provide data that will inform the development of an mHealth application (e.g. mobile phone application) for assisting patients in increasing their medication adherence. The developed mHealth intervention will then undergo a pilot trial to test its acceptability, satisfaction, and feasibility among 56 patients living with SCD.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a genetic defect that affects how hemoglobin is made. Due to this, people with SCD have abnormally-shaped red blood cells, which can result in poor oxygen transport in the body and increase risk of blood clots. CRISPR Cas9 is a new tool which allows scientists to snip and edit genes in a way that is faster, cheaper, and more precise than other gene-editing tools. Recently, research has been done using CRISPR Cas9 to correct the sickle cell gene in animal models and human cells. Researchers want to understand the views of those with SCD, parents of people with SCD, and the providers of these patients regarding use of CRISPR Cas9 in clinical trials and treatment.

Objectives:

To study the attitudes, beliefs, and opinions of those with SCD, parents of those with SCD, and providers on the use of CRISPR Cas9 gene-editing. An additional purpose of this study is to assess the utility of an educational tool for improving understanding of CRISPR Cas9.

Eligibility:

People ages 18 and older who speak English and either have SCD, are a parent of someone with SCD, or are a physician for people with SCD.

Design:

Participants will be screened via phone. Those with SCD will be screened with data from their SCD genotype.

Participation lasts about 2 hours.

Participants will fill out three surveys.

Participants will watch a video about CRISPR Cas9.

Participants will engage in a focus group session. This will be audiotaped and analyzed.

The data from the survey questions and focus groups may be used for future research. However, all personally identifiable information will be removed before data is shared.

Participants data will be identified with a code number instead of their name.

VDD is also quite common in sickle cell disease (SCD). Both VDD and SCD can cause chronic pain, compression fractures, and muscle weakness. The investigators believe VDD may contribute to poor musculoskeletal health and chronic pain seen in pediatric SCD. In this study, the investigators aim to show that children and adolescents with SCD and chronic pain have lower levels of vitamin D compared to those without chronic pain. The investigators also aim to determine the clinical characteristics in SCD patients related to their vitamin D status.

NCT03111589,Monocytic Expression of Heme Oxidase-1 (HO-1) in Sickle Cell Patients and Correlation With the Humoral Immune Response to Vaccine and With Allo-immunization.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03111589,COMPLETED,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from a substitution in the β chain of hemoglobin (Hb) which causes hemoglobin S to polymerize when deoxygenated. SCD patients present immune abnormalities that have always been attributed to functional asplenia. It it is now being recognized that patients with SCD have a pro-inflammatory condition with altered immune system activation contributing to the pathology of SCD. Increased levels of neutrophils, monocytes or cytokines have been reported in SCD patients.

SCD is associated with many acute and chronic complications requiring immediate support. Actual strongly recommended therapies include chronic blood transfusions (CT) and hydroxyurea (HU). In addition, episodic transfusions are recommended and commonly used to manage many acute SCD complications.There is strong evidence to support the use of HU in adults with 3 or more severe vaso-occlusive crises during any 12-month period, with SCD pain or chronic anemia, or with severe or recurrent episodes of acute chest syndrome. HU use is now also common in children with SCD. Some patients receive chronic monthly RBC transfusion with the objective to reduce the proportion of HbS to \< 30 %. Long-term RBC transfusions prevent and treat complications of SCD decreasing the risk of stroke and the incidence of acute chest syndrome (ACS).

Therapeutic complications, such as alloimmunization against RBC in 20-50% of patients or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) graft rejection, constitute an immune-based clinical issue in SCD. Poorly understood RBC alloimmunization is responsible for serious hemolytic transfusion reaction associated with severe mortality and morbidity underlying the need for a better understanding of the immunology of SCD to improve SCD transfusion support/outcome. Little evidence exists about HU effects on immune functions in SCD. HU treatment doesn't appear to have deleterious effects on immune function and appears to decrease the abnormally elevated number of total WBC and lymphocytes, while CT does not.

Patients with SCD are at higher risk of infections and prophylactic vaccination is strongly recommended. Recent data suggest that vaccinal response to pneumococcal antigens in SCD patients is identical to healthy control while controversy concern the stability of the immune protection after vaccination of SCD patient. Antibody levels declined over the year and the need for more frequent vaccination in SCD patient should be investigated. Currently, there is no evidence whether HU may interfere with pneumococcal immune response. Purohit showed that immune response to inactivated influenza A (H1N1) virus vaccine was altered in patient with SCD receiving CT but little is known on immune response to vaccination in patients with SCD receiving HU.

Recent data suggest that not only inflammatory status but also humoral immune response to antigens in SCD patients may differ according to treatment. Yazdanbakhsh reported an imbalance between regulatory T cell (Treg) and effector T cell (Teff) in alloimmunized SCD patients with as consequence an increase in antibody production. In a model proposed by the authors, the balance between Treg and Teff is dictated by the monocyte control of cytokines expression. Altered activity of monocyte heme oxidase-1 (HO-1) would be responsible of a decrease in IL-12 and an increase in IL-10 cytokines secretion impacting the Treg/Teff cells ratio and promoting antibody production by B cells.

The objectives of the project are to assess whether different humoral immune responses to vaccines or to erythrocyte alloantigens are related to the type of treatment administered to patients with SCD.

* Flow-mediated dilation (FMD): An ultrasound picture of the artery in the forearm is obtained. A blood pressure cuff is then placed on the upper arm and inflated for 5 minutes. After the pressure cuff is released, the ultrasound is repeated.
* Peripheral artery tonometry (PAT): A sensor is placed on the subject s finger. The sensor puts pressure on the finger and measures blood flow.
* Standard forearm blood flow test: Small tubes are placed in the artery of the forearm at the inside of the elbow. Saline is infused into one tube. Pressure cuffs are applied to the wrist and upper arm. A strain gauge (rubber band device) is placed around the forearm. When the cuffs are inflated, blood flows into the arm, stretching the strain gauge, and the flow measurement is recorded. Blood samples are collected from the tube in the artery to measure blood counts, proteins and other chemicals. At various times, small doses of the following drugs are administered through the tube in the vein:

  * Sodium nitroprusside causes blood vessels to dilate and increases blood flow to the heart.
  * Acetylcholine causes blood vessels to dilate and slows heart rate.
  * LNMMA decreases blood flow by blocking the production of nitric oxide.

Blood flow is measured after each dose of the different drugs. There are rest periods between injections of the different drugs. Pictures of the forearm are taken during the studies using an infrared camera and computer.

NCT04046705,Comparison of Allogeneic Matched Related Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation After a Reduced Intensity Conditioning Regimen With Standard of Care in Adolescents and Adults With Severe Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04046705,UNKNOWN,"Although the survival of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) has dramatically improved over the last decades in the US and Europe, mortality remains high in adults. Moreover, many children and most adults develop a chronic debilitating condition due to organ damage. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the unique curative approach; it allows the cure of more than 95% of children transplanted from a matched related donor (MRD) after a myeloablative conditioning regimen.To date, few studies have addressed the role of HSCT in SCD adults, due to the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and to the toxicity expected in older patients with a higher risk of organ damage. The development of safe, non-myeloablative conditioning regimens that allow stable mixed chimerism and avoid GVHD appears as an attractive option for HSCT to cure adults with severe SCD. The investigators design a prospective multicenter trial targeting patients over 15 years with severe SCD, and compare non-myeloablative transplant (when a matched related donor (MRD) is identified) versus no HSCT (for patients lacking MRD). The main objective is to assess the benefit of HSCT on the 2-year event free survival compared to standard care.

Primary Hypotheses:

Compared to baseline, young adult patients with sickle cell disease who receive the music therapy interventions will report:

1. Higher sickle cell self-efficacy as measured by the Sickle Cell Self Efficacy Scale (SCSES),
2. Higher trust in health care providers as measured by the Wake Forest Trust in the Medical Profession Scale, and
3. Higher sickle cell disease knowledge as measured by the Seidman Sickle Cell Knowledge Quiz.

Secondary Hypotheses

1. Compared to the one year prior to the study period, young adults with sickle cell disease who receive the music therapy interventions will have a higher rate of adherence to clinic appointments during the one-year study period.

Additional Questions

1. Do music therapy interventions influence attendance to scheduled blood transfusions?
2. Do music therapy interventions influence the rate of hospital utilization as measured by Emergency Department visits, Acute Care Clinic visits, and admissions during the study period compared to the previous year?
3. Do music therapy interventions influence adherence to hydroxyurea therapy for patients receiving hydroxyurea as measured by change in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) during the study period?

- Many people with sickle cell disease have repeated episodes of severe pain that lasts for days, requiring hospital care. These episodes, called pain crises, may be caused by changes in blood flow. Researchers want to study blood flow in people with sickle cell disease who are having a pain crisis and compare it with their blood flow after the pain crisis has resolved. They also want to compare these measurements against blood flow in healthy people who do not have sickle cell disease.

Objectives:

- To study whether changes in blood flow cause pain crises in people with sickle cell disease.

Eligibility:

* Individuals at least 18 years of age who have sickle cell disease and are being treated for a pain crisis.
* Individuals at least 18 years of age who have sickle cell disease and are not experiencing a pain crisis.
* Healthy volunteers matched by age and gender with the participants who have sickle cell disease.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected.
* Participants having a sickle cell pain crisis will have two visits, one during the crisis and one about 4 weeks after the crisis has resolved.
* Participants not having a sickle cell pain crisis will have one or two study visits. Blood samples will be collected during at least one of these visits.
* Healthy volunteers will have one or two study visits. Blood samples will be collected during at least one of these visits.
* During each visit for all participants, cameras and blood flow monitoring equipment will be used to measure blood flow in the forearm.

NCT01950429,Evaluation of Sickle Cell Liver Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01950429,COMPLETED,"Background:

- Sickle cell disease changes the shape of red cells. This makes them more likely to break down as they get stuck in small blood vessels. This leads to low red cell count and also damage to small blood vessels that supply many organs. One of the affected organs is the liver. Sickle cell disease and its treatment through blood transfusion can lead to significant liver damage. This disease also can cause the liver to regrow abnormally after damage. This can cause high blood pressure in the liver. Researchers want to know if curing sickle cell disease with a stem cell transplant improves liver damage.

Objectives:

- To explore specific factors that improve or worsen sickle cell liver disease after a stem cell transplant.

Eligibility:

- Adults ages 18 and older with sickle cell liver disease.

Design:

* Participation will take approximately 7 days over 2 years.
* Visit 1: participants will be screened with medical history and review of current treatment regimen.
* Visit 2: participants will return to the clinic for explanation of the study and physical exam. They will also have blood and urine tests, and scans of the liver.
* All participants will have a 2-night stay at the clinic. They will have a liver biopsy and a test of liver pressure. They will be sedated and a tube will be inserted in a vein in their neck.

NCT00386048,Pain Management Protocol for Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00386048,COMPLETED,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a devastating chronic health condition that primarily affects African-Americans. Painful episodes are the most frequent form of morbidity in SCD and the most frequent reason for hospitalization. Cognitive-behavioral interventions for pain management have shown efficacy for improving coping abilities, reducing the amount of medication needed to manage pain, and improving daily functioning during painful episodes. However, difficulties with disseminating and implementing cognitive-behavioral treatments have resulted in almost no use of these techniques in pediatric settings. In South Carolina these difficulties are compounded by social and geographical factors that pose particular challenges. A major issue with implementing quality pain management protocols is the difficulty with providing adequate practice and monitoring of the use of the techniques, particularly given the rural population in South Carolina and transportation difficulties for economically disadvantaged families. Due to a history of under-treating pain in SCD it is also critical that psychological and medical treatments are presented in an integrated manner so that these approaches are viewed as complimentary, not mutually exclusive, approaches to pain management. Finally, we believe the same implementation issues for improving the use of behavioral coping skills are also important for improving adherence to medication protocols for appropriate home-based pain management.

The purpose of this proposal is to develop, implement, and evaluate a pain management protocol that uses portable electronic devices and other technologies to increase the practice of psychosocial pain management techniques, improve adherence to the overall biopsychosocial pain management protocol, and improve the clinician's ability to track progress with fewer office visits. In addition to addressing important dissemination issues, by embedding methods to assess for adherence into the technology it will be possible to continuously evaluate and modify protocol efficacy, resulting in a product that is effective, empirically sound, and flexible. Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention or waitlist control condition. Those on the waitlist condition will receive the same study procedures after a 2 month wait periods.

Affected children suffer chronic ill health with some having frequent hospitalization.

SCV is associated with the high risk of stroke. Such injury may manifest with neurological and cognitive impairment.

NCT00005782,Mobilization and Handling of Stem Cells for Transplant From Healthy Volunteers With Sickle Cell Trait,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00005782,COMPLETED,"This study will examine the effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on bone marrow stem cells in healthy volunteers with sickle cell trait and determine if cells collected for transplantation from donors with sickle cell trait require special handling.

Stem cells, which the bone marrow produces, are responsible for making all the different kinds of blood cells. They are the cells used in bone marrow, or stem cell, transplantation. The drug G-CSF, which is a naturally occurring hormone, causes stem cells to mobilize-that is, to be released from the bone marrow and enter the blood stream. This drug is given to stem cell donors to increase the amount of cells that can be collected. Stem cell donors for patients with sickle cell disease are often healthy siblings of the patient who have a matching bone marrow type. Some siblings carry the sickle cell trait, however, and, even though they do not have sickle cell disease and their blood and bone marrow are normal, it is not known how their cells will react to G-CSF stimulation. Nor is it known if their stem cells require special methods of removal, processing or storing.

Healthy volunteers 18 years or older with sickle cell trait who have no history of sickle cell disease and no known medical problems may be eligible for this study. Participants will have a medical history and physical examination, including blood tests and urinalysis. They will receive injections of G-CSF under the skin once a day for 5 days. On the fifth day, stem cells will be collected through leukapheresis. In this procedure, whole blood is drawn from an arm vein, similar to donating whole blood. The blood then circulates through a cell separator machine, the stem cells are removed, and the rest of the blood is transfused back to the donor through a vein in the other arm.

The information gained from this study will be used to ensure the safety of stem cell donors with sickle cell trait and to better prepare stem cells for transplantation in sickle cell patients.",NO,Sickle Cell Trait,DRUG: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor|PROCEDURE: Leukapheresis,,,,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK),,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,12,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: |Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2000-01,,2002-07,"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States",

Initially, each patient will be treated for 6 weeks with placebo or a standard dose of propranolol (40 mg) every 12 hrs. This will be followed by a 2-week washout period after which, patients will receive the other treatment modality (placebo or propranolol).

We Hypothesize that propranolol administered in vivo on a daily basis for 6 weeks (1) will decrease baseline adhesion to endothelial cells and will substantially abrogate epinephrine-stimulated adhesion to endothelial cells, as measured in vitro; (2) will improve biomarkers of endothelial activation and dysfunction; and (3) can be safely used in patients with SCD. Thus, the use of propranolol in SCD may represent a safe and effective means of anti-adhesive therapy in SCD.

Patients presenting will often require immediate treatment for their pain and often times this will include opioids. The opioid epidemic has cost thousands of lives; and continues to be a significant problem posing several challenges when treating patients presenting with sickle cell disease. Primarily, opioids remain the mainstay of treatment for these patients and the push to address the opioid crisis may present challenges for adequate opioid administration in patients suffering from a sickle cell crisis while hospitals find ways to curb the opioid crisis overall. Opioid treatment for patients in acute vaso-occlusive crisis has significantly contributed to quality of life and life expectancy of patients with this diagnosis. Measures should continue to attempt to administer a multi-model approach to sickle cell patients to minimize the morphine milligram equivalents in these patients while also successfully addressing the patient's pain. IV lidocaine is a pain medication that has been evaluated in several painful experiences, such as in renal colic. A few case reports have shown IV lidocaine use in sickle cell can be a potential effective adjunct medication to opioids to treat pain and reduce further opioid requirements. Currently, no prospective controlled trial exists to evaluate the true benefit of IV lidocaine in this population.

NCT01987908,Evaluation of Different Dose Regimens of Aes-103 Given for 28 Days to Subjects With Stable Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01987908,TERMINATED,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder characterized by the presence of sickle-shaped red blood cells. In the U.S. and the U.K. this occurs primarily in persons of African origin. There is only one drug (hydroxyurea) approved to manage SCD, but it is not fully efficacious and can produce medically significant side effects. Aes-103 is being evaluated as a novel agent for the long term management of SCD. By directly reducing the sickling process, Aes-103 has a different mechanism of action than hydoxyurea. The active ingredient in Aes-103 is 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, a naturally occurring small molecule that is chemically related to glucose.

Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a blood disorder that occurs mainly in people of African descent. Researchers want to learn more about the painful attacks and complications associated with SCD. They want to look for a relationship between SCD and specific changes in the blood. They want to study the role of genetics, inflammation, and blood clotting factors in SCD. They will do this with blood samples collected during an acute painful attack and in between attacks.

Objective:

To learn more about the painful attacks and complications associated with SCD.

Eligibility:

People ages 18-80 with SCD or who are healthy Africans or African Americans without SCD

Design:

* Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam.
* Healthy participants will have one visit.
* Participants with SCD will have their first visit when they are not having a pain attack. They will have their next visit during a pain attack. About 3-4 months after this attack, they will have a final visit.
* Visits will include a physical exam, and blood and urine tests.

Sickle cell pain is different for every patient. Some patients get complete relief from routine pain medicines, and others need more time or more doses of pain medicines before the pain goes away completely. It is known that humans have many types of pain, including something called neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain in other conditions (such as diabetes) has been treated successfully with a medicine called gabapentin. The investigators in this study suspect that some sickle cell pain is a combination of pain types. They would like to see if adding gabapentin to the usual pain medicines makes pain go away faster or more completely.

Primary Objective:

* To assess the analgesic efficacy of gabapentin vs. placebo for pain during vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in participants with sickle cell disease (SCD). A response to study drug will be defined by a decrease in pain score of ≥ 33% between presentation to the acute care setting and assessment at 3 hours post administration of study drug.

NCT02227472,Working Memory and School Readiness in Preschool-Aged Children With Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02227472,COMPLETED,"Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk for neurobehavioral problems because of the impact the disease can have on the central nervous system. Specific impairments in working memory are particularly prevalent in school-aged children with SCD. Working memory is more strongly associated with school readiness and academic success than intellectual ability in the general population. The adverse effects of low socioeconomic status (SES) and poverty on cognition and neurodevelopment emerge early, before children have entered formal education. In addition, they affect language and executive function skills (e.g., working memory) more than other skills. SES is a proxy variable for other risk factors. Higher SES is associated with less parental stress, more supportive parenting practices, and better cognitive stimulation based on the availability of books, computers, and outings.

NCT03976180,High-flow Oxygen for Vaso-occlusive Pain Crisis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03976180,UNKNOWN,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by recurrent vaso-occlusive pain crisis (VOC), which may evolve to acute chest syndrome (ACS), the most common cause of death among adult patients with SCD. Currently, there is no safe and effective treatment to abort VOC or prevent secondary ACS. Management of VOC mostly involve a symptomatic approach including hydration, analgesics, transfusion, and incentive spirometry, which was investigated in a very limited number of patients (\<30).

The polymerisation of HbS is one major feature in the pathogenesis of vaso-occlusion. Among factors determining the rate and extent of HbS polymer formation, the hypoxic stimulus is one of the most potent and readily alterable. Current guidelines recommend oxygen therapy in patients with VOC in order to maintain a target oxygen saturation of 95%. Low-flow nasal oxygen (LFNO) is routinely used to achieve this normoxia approach, particularly in patients at risk of secondary ACS because they may experience acute desaturation. In contrast, various case series suggest a potential beneficial role of intensified oxygen therapy targeting hyperoxia for the management of VOC, particularly with the use of hyperbaric oxygen, but the latter is difficult to implement in routine clinical practice.

A recent high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) technology allows the delivery of humidified gas at high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) through nasal cannula. The FiO2 can be adjusted up to 100% (allowing hyperoxia that may reverse sickling) and the flow can be increased up to 60 L/min (which generates positive airway pressure and dead space flushing, that may prevent evolution of VOC towards ACS by alleviating atelectasis and opioid-induced hypercapnia). In patients with acute respiratory failure, HFNO has been shown to improve patient's comfort, oxygenation, and survival as compared to standard oxygen or non-invasive ventilation.

The aim of the present study is to test the efficacy and safety of HFNO for the management of VOC and prevention of secondary ACS.

Its clinical severity is widely heterogeneous among patients who share the same genetic mutation . Severe frequent pain crisis, recurrent acute chest syndrome and stroke are features of severe SCD. Hydroxyurea is an effective treatment of SCD as it ameliorates the severity and frequency of pain crisis and acute chest syndrome and decreases mortality, however, it is less effective in the prevention and treatment of stroke and other end organ dysfunctions . The only readily available cure of SCD is by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) . Most children with SCD who are treated by HSCT receive myeloablative conditioning with excellent results. The application of reduced intensity (RIC) and non-myeloablative (NMA) conditioning regimens are reserved for patients older than 16 years of age because of the increased risks of morbidity and mortality after HSCT6. However, infertility and gonadal failure after myeloablative conditioning are important barriers to the willingness of patients and their families to undergo HSCT . The development of an effective RIC HSCT in SCD that might spare the fertility of SCD patients would have obvious merit.

With the ultimate goal of expanding this curative therapy to SCD patients, we propose to investigate HSCT with a RIC conditioning regimen.

(1) It is characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin mainly responsible for vaso-occlusive clinical manifestations and chronic hemolysis with anemia. (2) It is therefore a chronic disease with major acute complications, such as acute chest syndrome. The treatment for this syndrome will be based on oxygenation, hydration and analgesia. At the physiotherapy level, we will have an action on the prevention and treatment of the syndrome by incentive spirometry. (3,4) In fact, it is currently the only physiotherapy treatment that has proven its effectiveness and is recommended for sickle cell patients. (3) As part of prevention, it is recommended to prescribe incentive spirometry during vaso-occlusive crisis. It has been shown to reduce the risk of atelectasis and significantly limit the risk of developing ACS. (5) In treatment, it makes it possible to regain normal chest amplification and therefore to allow ventilation of unventilated areas.

Adherence to treatment is a major problem in chronic diseases. Currently, it is estimated that 80% of patients with chronic conditions do not sufficiently follow their therapy, which limits the optimization of benefits. (6) This is the case in sickle cell patients, especially with hydroxyurea which is their disease-modifying treatment. Lack of adherence is the most common cause of primary failure of this treatment.

Indeed, we explained to the patient how to do the incentive spirometry, so that he could practice it several times a day as recommended.

NCT00072826,Atorvastatin Therapy to Improve Endothelial Function in Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00072826,COMPLETED,"This study will examine the effects of oral atorvastatin on the linings of blood vessels in patients with sickle cell disease, plus the agent's effect on blood markers of inflammation and blood vessel function. Sickle cell disease is a recessive genetic disorder and the most common genetic disease affecting African Americans. Inherited are abnormal genes that make hemoglobin, the substance within red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body. In the disease, sickle hemoglobin leads to rigidity or hardness of the red cells, causing obstruction in small blood vessels, inflammation, and injury to organs when the flow of blood to them is blocked. Some medications already prescribed for other diseases, such as atorvastatin, which is used for lowering cholesterol levels, can improve blood flow.

Patients 18 to 65 years of age who have sickle cell disease, who have not had an acute pain episode within the previous week, and who are not pregnant or lactating may be eligible for this study. They will undergo a complete medical history; physical examination; baseline blood tests; and echocardiogram, in which an ultrasound wand is placed against the chest wall to get images inside the heart and blood vessels.

In addition, patients will have blood flow studies. During the procedure, they will lie in an adjustable reclining chair for 5 to 6 hours. There will be 20- to 30-minute rests between specific activities and blood samples will be drawn intermittently for testing. Small tubes will be placed in the artery of the forearm at the inside of the elbow. Normal saline will be infused into one tube. A small pressure cuff will be applied to the wrist and a larger cuff to the upper arm. Both cuffs will be attached to an inflation device. A device like a rubber band, a strain gauge, will be placed around the widest part of the forearm. When the pressure cuffs are inflated, blood will flow into the arm, stretching the gauge proportion to blood flow, and information will be recorded. Then light reflected from the patients' hand and the blood flow in the forearm will be measured. Activity of the genes in the white blood cells will be measured as well. Small amounts of sodium nitroprusside, widely used to reduce blood pressure in people with dangerously high blood pressure, will be injected and blood flow will be measured. Later, small amounts of acetylcholine will be injected. It usually causes blood vessels to expand. After that, small amounts of L-NMMA will be injected. It usually decreases local blood flow by blocking the production of nitric oxide in the cells lining the arm's blood vessels. Then acetylcholine combined with L-NMMA will be injected. After that, oxypurinol, an agent taken by many patients to prevent gout, will be injected. The procedures will be repeated, with oxypurinol given along with each of the agents, and the measurement of blood flow in the forearm will be measured after each drug combination.

Afterward, patients will be treated for 4 weeks at home with oral atorvastatin. They will be asked to visit the Clinical Center every 2 weeks for collection of blood samples and an examination. After 4 weeks of taking atorvastatin orally, they will be asked to return to repeat the blood flow studies, but only the first half will be conducted. The part using oxypurinol will not be needed. Regarding some of the blood samples collected during the study, there will be an examination of the genes found in the white blood cells.

NCT00152113,Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplant for Patients With Sickle Cell Disease and Prior Stroke or Abnormal Transcranial Ultrasound,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00152113,COMPLETED,"Sickle cell disease is a life-long blood condition that can cause damage to the brain and other organs of the body. Children may develop severe, debilitating clinical states, with stroke or abnormal blood flow to the brain. Treatment generally includes chronic blood transfusions which may cause iron overload, potentially leading to severe and sometimes fatal complications.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplant using cells obtained from a sibling or an unrelated volunteer donor who is a perfect HLA ""match"" (same tissue type) for the recipient has shown to help, and possibly cure, sickle cell disease. Unfortunately, only about 10-20% of sickle cell patients have a HLA matched sibling donor, and the likelihood of locating an appropriate HLA matched unrelated donor through the various donor registries is limited.

Stem cells from partially HLA matched family members (also called haploidentical transplant) is an option currently being explored for this patient population. This type of transplant has been used and found to be successful in some patients, mostly those with cancers of the blood. However, there can be significant complications with haploidentical transplant, primarily infection, failure of the graft to grow (graft failure), and a disorder called graft-versus-host disease. In addition, few patients with sickle cell disease have undergone this procedure. Therefore, the risks and benefits of haploidentical transplants for patients with sickle cell disorder are not as well established as those using an HLA identical sibling or unrelated donor.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of haploidentical stem cell transplantation for children and adolescents with severe sickle cell disease and stroke or abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasound requiring chronic transfusion therapy. The treatment plan will be considered safe if there is not excessive toxicity. Toxicity for this protocol is defined as graft failure/graft rejection, severe acute GVHD, or regimen related death within 100 days after the last cellular product administered.

NCT02090881,Measurement of Cerebral Blood Flow Using Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound in Children With Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02090881,COMPLETED,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects haemoglobin - the molecule in blood cells which carries oxygen. It causes red blood cells to become abnormal crescent (or sickle)- shaped. Sickled red blood cells cannot travel through small blood vessels as easily as normal red blood cells which can lead to blockages. This means that oxygen may be prevented from getting to where it is needed. Individuals with sickle cell disease also suffer form abnormality in the lining of their blood vessels, which contributes to the damage.

Damage and blockage can occur in the blood vessels in the brain and means that children with sickle cell disease have a significant risk of suffering from strokes. Research has shown that transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can be used in this setting to identify children at most risk of getting strokes.

Ultrasound is therefore used in children with sickle cell disease to measure the blood flow in the vessels in the brain. This research has formed the basis of the National Health Service (NHS) Standard of Care for Sickle Cell Disease in the United Kingdom (UK) which uses transcranial Doppler ultrasonography at once a year to screen children with sickle cell disease aged 2 to 16.

Ultrasound is used because it is portable, does not uses ionising radiation such as x-rays, is non-invasive and gives good results. However, the results are dependent on the operator. This means that the screening service is provided by centres of excellence with experienced scanning staff visiting clinics in smaller hospitals with portable machines. There is a lack of research comparing the use of portable machines to laboratory-based machines. This is important because screening can identify children at high risk of stroke and may be used by clinical staff to make a decision about the care of the child.",YES,Sickle Cell Disease,OTHER: Ultrasound scan,"Measurement of Time Average Mean of the Maximum (TAMM) in cm/Sec in Cerebral Arteries Using 2 Different Ultrasound Machines., A flow phantom was used to compare Time average mean maximum velocity measurements from a Philips IU-22 and Zonare Z-One ultrasound machine. 25 children with SCD (aged 2-15 years) attending the outpatient clinic at St. Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust as part of the NHS Sickle Cell \& Thalassaemia (SC\&T) screening programme, were studied.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a disorder that causes episodes of acute pain and progressive organ damage. Ways to manage SCD have evolved slowly. Treatments do not always work. Researchers want to see if a drug called mitapivat can help people with SCD.

Objective:

To test the long-term tolerability and safety of mitapivat (or AG-348) in people with SCD.

Eligibility:

Adults age 18-70 with SCD who took part in and benefited from NIH study #19H0097.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will give a blood sample. They will have an electrocardiogram to test heart function.

Participants will repeat some of the screening tests during the study.

Participants will complete 6-minute walk tests to measure mobility and function. They will have transthoracic echocardiograms to measure heart and lung function. They will have dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans to measure bone health. They will complete online questionnaires that measure their overall health and well-being.

Participants will take the study drug in the form of a tablet twice a day.

Participants will keep a study diary. They will record any symptoms they may have.

Participation will last for about 54 weeks. After 48 weeks, participants can either keep taking the study drug for 48 more weeks or be tapered off of the study drug to complete the study.

The CHU Brugmann hospital currently regularly treats about 70 homozygous adult patients and this number is in constant augmentation. The age average of the patients is below 30. The hospital developed a close collaboration with the Queen Fabiola Kids University Hospital to optimize the transition of young sickle cell patients from the pediatric to the adult network.

The emergency care of sickle cell patients remains a source of worry. Even with a correct treatment (Hydroxy-urea or exsanguineous transfusions), patients suffer from frequent sickle cell disease crisis when stress or infection cause hemolysis. The pain level is intolerable and causes emergency hospital admission (2 to 3 crisis per patient per year on average). The crisis are more frequent with poor compliance to the treatments.

There are several obstacles to the rapid and optimal management of these patients:

* fear of causing addiction to heavy pain releaf products (high dosis of morphine)
* lack of biological parameters for the determination of the crisis severity.

The prognostic value of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level in a vaso-occlusive crisis was recently stressed while activation of the coagulation, translated by the elevation of various parameters including the rate of DD dimers, seemed associated with clinical complications. The deleterious role of increased oxidative stress has also been recently demonstrated in patients with sickle cell disease, opening new therapeutic avenues.

This study aims to prospectively evaluate the management of sickle cell patients being admitted in the emergency department for a vaso-occlusive crisis. The level of satisfaction of the patients will be measured.

To find out if a new antibody drug (briquilimab, JSP191) improves the success of a blood stem cell transplant

Eligibility:

People aged 13 or older who are eligible for a blood stem cell transplant to treat SCD. Healthy family members over age 13 who are matched to transplant recipients are also needed to donate blood.

Design:

Participants receiving transplants will undergo screening. They will have blood drawn. They will have tests of their breathing and heart function. They may have chest x-rays. A sample of marrow will be collected from a pelvic bone.

Participants will remain in the hospital about 30 days for the transplant and recovery. They will have a large intravenous line inserted into the upper arm or chest. The line will remain in place for the entire transplant and recovery period. The line will be used to draw blood as needed. It will also be used to administer the transplant stem cells as well as various drugs and blood transfusions. Participants will also receive some drugs by mouth.

Participants must remain within 1 hour of the NIH for 3 months after transplant. During that time, they will visit the clinic up to 2 times a week.

Follow-up visits will include tests to evaluate participants mental functions. They will have MRI scans of their brain and heart.",NO,Sickle Cell Anemia|Beta Thalassemia,RADIATION: TBI|DRUG: Hydroxyurea|BIOLOGICAL: briquilimab|DRUG: Filgrastim (G-CSF)|DRUG: Sirolimus|BIOLOGICAL: Alemtuzumab|DRUG: Plerixafor,"percent myeloid (CD14/15) chimerism, The primary objective is to determine if addition of CD117 antibody (JSP191) would increase proportion of patients with donor myeloid chimerism =98% at 1 year post transplant., 1 year post transplant","Transplant related mortality, Transplant related mortality, 1 and 2 years post transplant|Rates of graft failure, Rates of graft failure, 1 and 2 years post transplant|Rate of viral infection and/or reactivation, Rate of viral infection and/or reactivation, day 100|Alemtuzumab levels, To measure alemtuzumab clearance at 1 and 2 years post transplant, day 100|Rate of chronic GVHD, Rate of chronic graft vs host disease (GvHD), 1 and 2 years post transplant|Days to neutrophil engraftment, Day of neutrophil engraftment, day 100|JSP antibody PK levels, To measure JSP191 and alemtuzumab clearance at 1 and 2 years post transplant, day 100|Proportion of patients with donor myeloid chimerism at or above 75%, Estimate the proportion of patients with donor myeloid chimerism at or above 75%, 1 and 2 years post transplant|Non-transplant related mortality, Non-transplant related mortality, 1 and 2 years post transplant|Rate of bacterial infection, Rate of bacterial infection, 1 and 2 years post transplant|Rates of acute GVHD, Rate of acute graft vs host disease (GvHD), 1 and 2 years post transplant",,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)",,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,40,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2022-05-12,2026-01-31,2027-01-31,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States","Informed Consent Form, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/82/NCT05357482/ICF_000.pdf"

It reflects the global response of various physiological systems (respiratory, cardio-vascular, neurologic, metabolic and musculosquelettic) in a situation simulating a daily life activity. In children with sickle cell disease, the 6MWT is correlated with a low level of hemoglobin, a low level of fetal hemoglobin and low red cell deformability. Our team previously reported that in a population of children with sickle cell disease, highly treated with hydroxyurea, the sole factor which was independently linked to the 6MWT was the presence of silence infarct.

As the cardio-vascular and cerebro-vascular injury in sickle cell disease are directly correlated with hemolysis, the investigators aim to evaluate a) the clinical relevance of endothelial and inflammation parameters and new hemolysis markers and b) if the presence of silent infarct and the 6MWT are correlated with this biological markers.

This cross-sectional study will include sickle cell disease patients regularly followed for more than 5 years at Hôpital Universitaire des Enfants Reine Fabiola, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU)-Brugmann, Centre Hospitalier Etterbeek-Ixelles, CHU Saint-Pierre, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc (Bruxelles, Belgium). Inclusion criteria are: sickle cell disease (SS, Sbeta°, SC, Sbeta+), age range : 6 to 25 years, signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria are: transplanted patients, inability to perform the 6MWT (severe cognitive disability, femoral osteonecrosis with functional impairment), hospitalization and/ or transfusion in the last 3 months for acute event.

Demographic data and clinical data will be retrospectively recorded. Blood test and 6MWT will be performed in steady state. Studied analysis will be: coagulation factors, free hemoglobin, Pro-B type natriuretic peptide (Pro-BNP), High sensitivity C reactive protein (HS-CRP), Intercellular Adhesion Molecule (ICAM), Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule (VCAM) and Selectins.

NCT00113152,Heart Disease in Sickle Cell Anemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00113152,COMPLETED,"This study will explore what may cause people with sickle cell anemia to have heart problems and an increased risk of sudden death.

People 18 years of age and older with sickle cell anemia may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (heart ultrasound), and blood tests.

Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

* Holter monitoring: The patient wears a small, battery-operated device to record heart rate and rhythm over 24 to 48 hours.
* QRST surface mapping: An EKG using 64 electrodes is done at rest and during exercise to provide a detailed look at the heart and its conduction system.
* Chest x-rays are taken to examine the lungs.
* Bicycle exercise echocardiography test: Blood pressure, pulse, heart rhythm and oxygen use are monitored while the patient exercises on a stationary bicycle. Ultrasound pictures are also obtained during the exercise.
* Echocardiogram: A heart ultrasound is done to check how well the heart is pumping blood.
* Pulmonary artery catheterization: A catheter (plastic tube) is inserted into a vein and advanced to the chambers of the heart, through the heart valve and into the lung artery. The pressures in the heart and lung blood vessels are measured while the patient is resting and during exercise, with the bed tilted up and down, and after giving 500 mls of fluid into a vein.
* Blood tests are done to measure a hormone called brain natriuretic peptide, which can increase with the development of heart failure, and nitrite, a substance that can affect blood vessel dilation. Some blood is stored to test for inflammatory markers and for possible future gene and protein analysis.
* Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI): The patient lies in a donut-shaped magnet while pictures of the heart are obtained using a magnetic field and radio waves. Earplugs are worn to muffle the loud sounds that occur with electrical switching of the magnetic fields. A contrast agent called gadolinium may be injected to enhance the quality of the images.
* Invasive electrocardiographic (reveal) monitoring: This procedure permits study of the heart rhythms over a long time period. A small device is placed just under the skin on the left side of the chest.

Currently, the standard for pain assessment is a rating of pain intensity, as determined by observation (for younger children) or self-report (for older children and adolescents). However, these measures of pain intensity are not effective in recurrent or chronic pain states, and in sickle cell disease in particular. Pediatric patients who are hospitalized with vasoocclusive pain often do not report a decrease in pain intensity; however, other indications of clinical status, such as ambulation, less use of opiates from the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, increased food intake, and transition to oral pain medication, signify that the patient may be improving. As a result of our inability to get an accurate picture of the patients' condition, we would like to have a summary of improvement that would reflect these changes in clinical status and reflect the reduced impact of sickle cell pain on the patient's life. In this study, we plan to evaluate a standardized functional assessment measure in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease. It is hypothesized that FIM™ scores will correlate with other indicators of clinical status, such as movement, quality of sleep, use of IV opiates from the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, and use of intravenous vs. oral pain medications.

NCT00001716,Effects of Nitric Oxide and Nitroglycerin in Patients With Sickle Cell Anemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00001716,COMPLETED,"Sickle cell anemia is the most common genetic disease affecting African-Americans. About 1 in every 1000 African-Americans has the disease and 1 in every 12 carry the genes that could be passed on to their children. People with sickle cell anemia have abnormal hemoglobin, the molecules responsible for carrying oxygen in the blood. The abnormal hemoglobin can cause damage to the red blood cells. The damaged red blood cell may then stick in the blood vessels and cause pain and injury to organs. Some of the complications caused by the sticking of blood cells are called acute pain crisis and acute chest syndrome (ACS).

Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas that has been proposed as a possible therapy for the ACS complication of sickle cell anemia. Studies have shown that NO may favorably affect sickle cell hemoglobin molecules, thereby improving blood flow through small vessels.

This study is designed to evaluate the effects of NO, when taken in combination with a drug called nitroglycerin on patients with sickle cell anemia and normal volunteers. The effects of these two drugs only last while the patient is receiving them.

Hemolysis, vaso- occlusive and pain crises are hallmarks of this disease and are causative for an important socio-economic burden worldwide, especially in Africa.

Aside from allogenic stem cell transplantation, which is rarely available and very expensive, at present there is no curative treatment for patients with SCD. The current standard of care includes treatment with Hydroxyurea and symptomatic care such as transfusions, antibiotic/analgesic treatment. Recent findings allowed the investigators to come up with a novel pharmacological target for prophylactic treatment of this group of patients. The investigators showed that N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are substantially up-regulated in circulating red blood cells (RBCs) of SCD patients. Ca2+ uptake via these non-selective cation channels has major impact on RBC hydration and facilitates polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin S variant in RBCs of patients. In vitro observations shows that inhibition of NMDARs with Memantine caused re-hydration and largely prevented hypoxia-induced sickling in RBCs.

This chronic disease is characterized by the presence of abnormal Hemoglobin (Hb) S and a deformation of the red blood cells which take the elongated shape of a sickle and become more rigid and more fragile. Sickle cell disease manifests itself among other things by very painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) and for some chronic pain.

Their management is an emergency and often requires hospitalization. Despite analgesic treatment, some patients have persistent pain.

In 2013, a childcare assistant trained in Canadian global reflexology EMC offered reflexology sessions to 12 sickle cell patients.

This can result in painful episodes, serious infections, chronic anemia (a decrease in the number of red blood cells), and damage to body organs. Hydroxyurea therapy offers significant benefits for infants, children, and adolescents with sickle cell anemia. These include a reduction in the frequency of pain crises and acute chest syndrome (inflammation of the lungs) and an increase in hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein) in the blood. Patients on hydroxyurea who receive a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that is specific for them have greater clinical benefit than those who receive a standard lower dose. There is, however, no way currently to predict the MTD for individual patients. As such, MTD for each patient is currently determined by gradual increases in the dose over several months. This process is time-consuming, requires monthly clinic visits, and delays the benefits of hydroxyurea therapy.

Our research group has come up with an equation that could be used to predict each patient's MTD using baseline clinical and laboratory measures before starting hydroxyurea treatment. The purpose of this research study is to compare the use of our equation for predicting MTD to the current standard practice of gradually increasing the hydroxyurea dose until MTD is reached.

Patients with sickle cell disease 18 years of age or older may be eligible to participate in one or more parts of this three-stage study, as follows:

Stage 1

Patients undergo the following tests to determine the cause of their pulmonary hypertension: blood tests; echocardiogram (heart ultrasound); asthma test; oxygen breathing study with measurement of arterial blood oxygen levels; chest X-ray; lung scans; MRI of the heart; 6-minute walk test; night-time oxygen measurement while sleeping; and exercise studies.

Stage 2

Patients have a detailed MRI evaluation of the heart and are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center intensive care unit (ICU) for the following test: A plastic tube is placed in a vein in the patient's arm and another tube is placed in a deeper neck or leg vein. A third tube is inserted through the vein into the heart and the lung artery to measure blood pressures in the heart and lungs directly. Following baseline measurements, three medications (inhaled oxygen, infused prostaglandin, and inhaled NO) are delivered for 2 hours each, separated by a 30-minute washout period. A small blood sample is drawn during the NO administration.

Patients who cannot be treated with nitric oxide or for whom the treatment does not work may receive monthly exchange transfusions for 3 months. For this procedure, 3 to 5 five units of the patient's blood is removed and replaced with 3 to 5 units that do not have sickle hemoglobin. Some patients who do not respond to NO or exchange transfusions may receive an alternative therapy, such as oxygen, prostacyclin, L-arginine, bosentan or sidenafil.

Stage 3

Patients remain in the ICU with catheters in place for another 24 hours. During this time they breathe NO. Lung pressures are measured every 4 hours and blood is drawn every 8 hours. They then stay in the hospital 1 more day for observation. Patients then breathe nitric oxide continuously for 2 months using a tank of gas that delivers the NO through tubes placed in the nose. They may do this at home on an outpatient basis or may remain in the hospital for the 2 months.

NCT03958643,Best Noninvasive Predictor of Renal Function in Assessing Adult Sickle Nephropathy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03958643,COMPLETED,"Background:

Sickle cell disease is a common inherited blood disorder. Kidney disease is a major cause of problems in people with sickle cell disease. In order to identify kidney problems early and stop the progression of kidney disease, doctors need the most accurate tests to check kidney function. Researchers hope to understand more about how to test for kidney disease in people with sickle cell disease.

Objective:

To determine which of two different lab tests is the best to measure kidney function in adults with sickle cell disease.

Eligibility:

People 18 years and older who have sickle cell disease

Design:

Participants will be screened with a medical history and blood tests.

Participants will have up to 3 visits.

Participants will collect their urine in a special container over 24 hours.

At the first visit, participants will have blood tests. They will bring their container of urine to the visit. They will have an iothalamate test. For the test, they will get a catheter: a small tube will be inserted into a vein. A special contract agent will be injected into the vein. Blood will be collected over the next 4 hours to test kidney function.

Participants will return the next day for a second visit. They will have blood tests. They will have an MRI. For the MRI, they will like on a table that slides into a machine that takes pictures of the kidneys. They may have the MRI in a third visit.

NCT04844099,Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine or Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine for the Chemoprevention of Malaria in Sickle Cell Anaemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04844099,COMPLETED,"Sickle Cell Anaemia (SCA) is an inherited disease that makes the body produce red blood cells with abnormal sickle-shaped cells. The sickle-shaped cells are rigid, not flexible and break up easily resulting in anaemia. The abnormal cells also stick to the vessel walls, causing a blockage that slows or stops the flow of blood. When this happens, oxygen cannot reach nearby tissues. The lack of oxygen can cause attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain crises, stroke or damage to important organs such as the spleen. All of these can lead to death. These attacks can occur without warning and are often started and made worse by infections such as malaria. Therefore, in many countries in Africa where malaria is common, children with SCA are given malaria medicines to prevent the infection. However, many of the medicines do not work effectively, are too difficult to take or they have side effects, resulting in poor adherence.

The aim of this study is to find safe, acceptable and effective medicines for malaria prevention in children with SCA in eastern and southern Africa. The investigators propose to conduct a study to find out whether giving weekly doses of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, also called DP, is safe, more effective, acceptable and cost-effective than the current strategy of monthly sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to prevent malaria in children with sickle cell anaemia. Overall, 548 children aged 6 months to 15 years will be chosen randomly to receive either weekly DP or monthly SP for about 18 months. To test if the study medicine is effective, the study will compare the case burden of malaria. The investigators will also monitor every child for any type of illness, blood transfusions and other complications of sickle cell anaemia and admissions to the hospital. In addition, the study will evaluate the impact of DP on the development of resistance by malaria parasites. The study will also include nested safety studies on the effect of DP on the heart. All study participants will receive all the other usual care and treatments, including patient education on home care, and daily penicillin if younger than 5 years.

NCT04800809,The Afolabi Stroke Registry for Children and Young Adults With SCD in Northern Nigeria,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04800809,COMPLETED,"Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) occurs in 300,000 newborns per year in the world, with 150,000 affected births in Nigeria, alone. With improvement in survival for children with SCA in both high- and low-resource countries, neurological morbidity is an emerging significant public health challenge, particularly in countries with a high rate of sickle cell disease (SCD). Both silent cerebral infarcts (SCI) and overt strokes result in significant neurological morbidity and premature death. Five NIH-funded randomized controlled trials (RCT) demonstrated that regular blood transfusion or hydroxyurea therapy are efficacious treatments for primary and secondary stroke prevention in children with SCA. Despite the observation that at least 99% of children with SCA in high-resource settings reach adulthood, and approximately 60% of adults will experience one or more strokes (\~50% with SCI and \~10% with overt strokes) and the high disease-burden in Nigeria, the prevalence and incidence rates of new and recurrent stroke (overt and silent strokes)have not been collected systematically in children and young adults (16-25 years old) with SCA. In the last decade, there has been growing use of stroke registries in economically advanced nations, particularly for epidemiological purposes of trend analysis, clinical effectiveness, compliance to guidelines, assessment of implementation, adoption of novel techniques, and quality improvement process. For the first time in clinical centers in Nigeria, the Investigators will conduct an observational epidemiological study to document the prevalence and track the incidence of new and recurrent strokes in children and young adults with SCD. The Investigators will create a stroke registry referred to as the Afolabi Stroke Registry for Children and Young Adults with Sickle Cell Disease in Nigeria.

In this study two (2) different treatment plans of Patient-Controlled Analgesia will be used to treat people with sickle cell disease who are admitted to the hospital for a pain crisis. The purpose of this study is to find out if one plan is better than the other in controlling sickle cell pain.

If you are eligible for the study, you will be assigned by chance (like flipping a coin) to either get a higher continuous amount of the pain medicine with a smaller amount for pain as you need it, OR to get a smaller continuous amount of pain medicine with a larger amount of pain medicine as you need it. You or your study doctor can not choose which plan you receive, and you will not be told which one you have been assigned to. The doctors and nurses taking care of you will know which plan you are assigned to so they can safely and effectively take care of your pain. Some members of the study team will not know which plan you are on.

We will give you morphine sulfate or hydromorphone (dilaudid) for your pain. These medicines are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have been used for a long time to relieve pain. If you have been treated for pain before with hydromorphone (dilaudid) and you prefer it to morphine, then you may choose to get it during the study. If you have not received hydromorphone (dilaudid) before or you do not have a preference then you will be given morphine for pain.

The pain medicine will be given through the IV in your arm. You will receive morphine or hydromorphone continuously through the IV and will also be able to use the PCA machine to give yourself extra pain medicine as you need it for pain.

NCT04244240,"Links Between Cognitive Functions and Clinical, Biological and Neuroradiological Outcomes in Adults With Sickle Cell Disease.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04244240,COMPLETED,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder. Symptoms include acute and chronic complications. Due to progress in SCD care, patients with SCD are living longer than before and we focus more attention in chronic complications.

Children with SCD experience worse cognitive functions than healthy children, and fewer is known about cognitive functions in adults. Studies suggest lower cognitive performance in SCD, mostly in executive functions and processing speed, but the biological and anatomical substrates of cognitive decline are not yet well established in SCD. Often times, cognitive impairments and cerebral disorders are not diagnosed and treated in adults with SCD.

The main objective of this study is to propose a deep neuropsychological assessment in adults with SCD and cognitive complaints and to highlight links between cognitive functions and clinical, biological and neuroradiological markers. The hypothesis of this study is that cognitive functions are associated with severity of the SCD, with bood abnormalities, with MRI markers and Transcranial Doppler (TCD) markers of cerebrovascular disease.

Then a relation between, inspiratory volume, pain and the length of hospital stay will be identified .

Currently, there is no scientific data regarding the correlation between acute pain during vaso-occlusive crisis, incentive spirometry and the impact on length of hospital stay. In fact, physiotherapist experience's in the pediatric department suggests that the pain expressed by the child is not always correlated with inspiratory capacity.

The absence of pain is one of the reasons for hospital discharge after decompensation in patients with sickle cell disease. However, no scientific study has linked incentive spirometry, pain and length of hospital stay.

Investigator assume that these children underestimate the real pain and its impact on breathing pattern, and presume that the maximal inspiratory volume during spirometry sessions will be a better reflect of pain than standard pain scale.

NCT01393847,Nitric Oxide and Sickle Cell Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01393847,TERMINATED,"Background:

- Sickle cell disease often causes crises, with episodes of pain. Many people with sickle cell disease also have pain between crises. Inflammation is an important part of sickle cell pain. It may be related to levels of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is a gas in the body that helps relax blood vessels and may be related to the pain from sickle cell disease. Researchers want to study the relationship between blood levels of nitric oxide and pain in people with sickle cell disease. Researchers also want to study how certain genes express themselves related to sickle cell pain.

Objectives:

- To collect blood samples and other genetic expression information to study sickle cell pain and its relation to nitric oxide levels in the blood.

Eligibility:

* People at least 18 years of age who have sickle cell disease.
* Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.

Design:

* This study requires a screening visit and four study visits scheduled 1 week apart. Each visit will last about 1 hour.
* Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will complete questionnaires about pain levels (if any). They will also provide blood samples for genetic and other testing.
* Participants will have a breath test to see how much nitric oxide they exhale. They will also have a test of their ability to detect small changes in temperature and touch.
* Participants will keep a diary to record daily pain levels and pain medicines taken. They will write down what they eat to track foods that contain nitrates (such as meats like ham and bacon and vegetables like beets and spinach).
* At each of the four study visit, participants will bring the pain diary, provide blood samples, and have breath nitric oxide tests.",NO,Sickle Cell Disease|Pain,,Difference in whole blood gene expression in the peripheral blood of sickle cell subjects and matched controls during pain and pain-free states.,"Quantification of pain sensory perception, eNO, and laboratory correlates in sickle cell subjects and in matched controls",,National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,12,NIH,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2011-06-17,,2013-12-05,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States",

Circadian blood pressure, as defined by 24 hour blood pressure monitoring, is more accurate than clinic blood pressure in defining secondary hypertension and abnormal nocturnal blood pressured dipping and nocturnal hypertension have been linked to progressive renal disease in other diseases.

Methodology/Aims: A randomized feasibility trial of losartan will be conducted among adolescent HbSS and SB0 thalassemia patients (11-19 years) with abnormal nocturnal blood pressure dipping. During this six month feasibility trial, two dosing strategies of losartan (titrated to keep clinic BP \<95th percentile vs. \<75th percentile) will be analyzed for safety and effect on restoring normal circadian blood pressure.

A prospective cohort study among HbSS and SB0 thalassemia patients (6-19 years) will also be conducted to evaluate the incidence of hypertension and role of monitoring potential biomarkers of kidney injury and hypertension. Cohort participants will undergo annual evaluations of hypertension(24 hour blood pressure monitoring for participants ≥ 11yrs, clinic BP in all participants) and markers of kidney injury/hypertension.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) were studied and used in diabetic nephropathy. In a study on 26 sickle cell adults, albuminuria was reduced about 50% by ACE compared to placebo after six months treatment. It might be interesting studying ACE efficacy in sickle cell children with microalbuminuria because renal disease is directly related to sickle cell and is not influenced by other cardiovascular risk factors like in adult patients.

NCT04406818,Metabolic and Hemodynamic Reserve in Pediatric SCA,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04406818,RECRUITING,"The purpose of this research study is to better understand how blood flow and metabolism change can influence brain development in the early decades of life. SCA participants and healthy controls are age and sex-matched for comparison. Within the SCA cohort, children with infarcts may have thinner cortices than those without, reflecting a greater loss.

The investigators will examine brain blood flow and metabolism using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The brain's blood vessels expand and constrict to regulate blood flow based on the brain's needs. The amount of expanding and contracting the blood vessels may vary by age. The brain's blood flow changes in small ways during everyday activities, such exercise, deep concentration, or normal brain growth. Significant illness or psychological stress may increase the brain's metabolic demand or cause other bigger changes in blood flow. If blood vessels are not able to expand to give more blood flow when metabolic demand is high, the brain may not get all of the oxygen it needs. In extreme circumstances, if the brain is unable to get enough oxygen for a long time, a stroke may occur. Sometimes small strokes occur without other noticeable changes and are only detectable on an MRI. These are sometimes called ""silent strokes."" In less extreme circumstances, not having a full oxygen supply may cause the brain to grow and develop more slowly than when it has a full supply.

One way to test the ability of blood vessels to expand is by measuring blood flow while breathing in carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide causes blood vessels in the brain to dilate without increasing brain metabolism.

NCT00005783,A Phase I/II Trial of Recombinant-Methionyl Human Stem Cell Factor (SCF) in Adult Patients With Sickling Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00005783,COMPLETED,"Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder that results from a single nucleotide substitution in codon 6 of the beta-globin gene which, in the homozygous state, produces an abnormal hemoglobin that is prone to polymer formation when deoxygenated. The polymerized hemoglobin leads to impaired deformability and sickling of red blood cells which subsequently lodge in end-arterioles producing the classic and most prominent feature of the disorder, repeated vasoocclusive crises. Despite knowledge of the precise genetic defect for decades, only recently has there been therapeutic impact based upon this knowledge when a clear benefit from treatment with hydroxyurea, a cell cycle-specific agent administered to induce production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) by stimulating gamma-globin synthesis, was reported in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The reduction in the frequency and severity of vasoocclusive crises seen has been attributed to the increase in HbF levels in responsive patients. While the majority of patients demonstrate a rise in HbF, not all such patients benefit from treatment. Given these results, alternative agents that also stimulate the production of HbF warrant investigation in the treatment of SCD. Recombinant-methionyl human stem cell factor (SCF) is a hematopoietic growth factor with activity on immature hematopoietic progenitor cells. SCF stimulates the production of HbF in vitro and in vivo, and this effect is attainable without the myelosuppression associated with hydroxyurea.

NCT04351698,SMILES: Study of Montelukast in Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04351698,RECRUITING,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood condition causing long term health problems including pain and brain problems which affect quality of life. These may be made worse if patients have low night-time oxygen levels when the upper airways close repeatedly during the night (obstructive sleep apnoea). This is associated with increased pain, poorer concentration and increased kidney problems. Montelukast, widely used in the treatment of Asthma, has been shown to improve symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea in patients without sickle cell anaemia. Investigators think this treatment could be useful in patients with sickle cell disease too. Early intervention with Montelukast could help prevent deterioration in concentration and thinking skills.

The aim of this trial is to see whether young children with sickle cell disease randomised (randomise: the same as tossing a coin and not knowing whether it will come up heads or tails) to Montelukast treatment have better thinking skills compared with people randomised to placebo (tablet with no active medical ingredients - i.e. ""sugar pill"").

NCT03599609,Central Nervous System Vascular Changes in Adult Sickle Cell Disease and the Effect of Treatment With Simvastatin,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03599609,UNKNOWN,"Stroke is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), with varying levels of central nervous system (CNS) involvement. The summation of several ischemic events, even when silent, can lead to devastating consequences, from reduced academic performance to physical dependence. Despite knowledge that brain flow velocities evaluated by Doppler ultrasound identify pediatric SCD patients at a greater stroke risk (Adams et al, NEJM 1998; 339:5-11), this method is not able to predict the occurrence of strokes in adults. There is also no consensus on the management of adult patients in relation to primary and secondary prevention. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the administration of Simvastatin on CNS structural and functional vascular changes in 30 adult patients with SCD (SS and Sβ), above 35 years of age, observed through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The data on the effect of simvastatin on disease manifestations is quite scarce, however this drug reportedly significantly reduces plasma concentrations of adhesion molecules and inflammatory markers, such as E-selectin, VEGF, CRP and IL-6 (Hoppe et al, BJH 2011; 153:655-663; Hoppe et al, BJH 2017;177:620-629). Thus, in addition to the search for early diagnostic markers and risk stratification for primary or recurrent stroke, we will also compare CNS images before and 12 months after the administration of Simvastatin. The drug alter stroke recurrence rates in the general adult population, but their effects on vascular changes in patients with SCD have not yet been adequately elucidated. This is particularly important because these are low cost drugs which present good tolerability, and could be part of the therapeutic arsenal of SCD, even in low income settings. Concomitantly with the CNS evaluation, this study also intends to investigate molecular pathways that may be affected by the drugs. We will evaluate microvesicle release patterns, as well as the content of microRNAs possibly involved in the occurrence of stroke, in addition to metabolomic studies and plasma cytokine profile.",NO,Sickle Cell Disease|Stroke,DRUG: Simvastatin 40mg,"Stroke prevention, Number of patients in the cohort presenting srtoke or silent infarction detected at MRI, 5 years","Improvement of hemodynamic parameters in MRI:velocity, Evaluation of changes in vessel segment-averaged velocity (cm/s) in the Circle of Willis, 1 year|Improvement of hemodynamic parameters in MRI: lumen area, Evaluation of changes in vessel lumen area (mm2) in the Circle of Willis, 1 year|Improvement of hemodynamic parameters in MRI: flow, Evaluation of changes in flow (ml/s) in the Circle of Willis, 1 year|Improvement of hemodynamic parameters in MRI: endothelial shear stress, Evaluation of changes in endothelial shear stress (Pa) in the Circle of Willis, 1 year",,"University of Campinas, Brazil",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,28,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,2018-03-05,2020-01-14,2021-07,"Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Campinas, São Paulo, 13083-870, Brazil",

- Chronic leg ulcers are a complication of many blood disorders such as sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and other red blood cell disorders. In these disorders, red blood cells break down earlier than normal, which researchers suspect may cause or contribute to the development of leg ulcers; however, the exact cause is unknown, and current therapies are not very effective. Researchers are interested in determining if a research cream made with sodium nitrite, a substance that is known to increase blood flow by dilating blood vessels, may speed up the healing of skin ulcers.

Objectives:

- To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of topical sodium nitrite cream as a treatment for chronic leg ulcers in individuals with sickle cell disease or other red blood cell disorders.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have sickle cell disease or another red cell disorder and have had a leg ulcer for more than 4 weeks.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood tests, and an examination of the ulcer, including x-ray of the leg(s) with the ulcer and swabs from the wound.
* Participants will be scheduled for a 5-day inpatient stay at the Clinical Center, with the following procedures:
* Days 1 and 2: Participants will have blood draws, a wound assessment, ultrasound of the affected leg, imaging studies (magnetic resonance imaging and infrared photography), thermo-patch application to monitor temperature changes, measurements of blood flow in the skin, and questionnaires about pain and quality of life. An optional skin biopsy may also be conducted with samples taken near the skin ulcer
* Day 3: Participants will have one ulcer treated with the topical cream. Frequent blood draws will be conducted before application and then regularly for up to 6 hours after application of the cream. Thirty minutes after the research cream is applied, participants will have imaging studies of the treated leg and measurements of pain levels and blood flow.
* Day 4: Participants will have a blood draw and temperature recordings taken.
* Day 5: Participants will have the research cream applied and the same imaging studies as before, and will be discharged for care at home.
* For the following 3 weeks, participants will come to the clinical center twice a week to have the research cream applied to the leg ulcer and tests performed by the study researchers.
* For the fourth and final week, participants will return for additional cream treatment sessions, imaging studies, blood draws, and other tests as directed by the study researchers.
* Study participation will end in the following week (week 5).

NCT01375608,Decitabine for High-Risk Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01375608,COMPLETED,"Background:

* In sickle cell disease (SCD), the proteins in the red blood cells that carry oxygen do not behave normally. In parts of the body where there are low levels of oxygen or where oxygen is used more, the sickle hemoglobin proteins may change shape and stick together. This causes the red cells to clump, which reduces blood flow. This leads to even lower oxygen levels and causes damage and/or pain.
* One way to stop the red blood cells from sticking together is to increase the levels of fetal (baby or good ) hemoglobin. The good hemoglobin then takes the place of the sickle hemoglobin.
* Hydroxyurea is the only approved drug for SCD. But hydroxyurea works in only about two-thirds of people with SCD. Even in those cases it sometimes stops working over time.
* Researchers are interested in testing decitabine. The drug may help to increase fetal hemoglobin levels. But it has not yet been approved to treat SCD.

Objectives:

- To test the safety and effectiveness of decitabine in increasing fetal hemoglobin levels and improving the symptoms of sickle cell disease.

Eligibility:

- People at least 18 years of age who have sickle cell disease that has not improved after at least 6 months of hydroxyurea therapy. Those who cannot take hydroxyurea because of side effects may also participate.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have blood and urine tests, a lung function test, and other tests as required.
* Participants will receive decitabine injections up to twice a week for 1 year. Depending on the response to treatments, the dose will remain the same or be reduced to once a week.

NCT04705792,Physical Rehabilitation in Sickle Cell Anemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04705792,UNKNOWN,"Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is one of the most neglected diseases worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. In the adult population with SCA, the systemic effects of the disease, such as respiratory and peripheral muscle dysfunction, cause a decrease in quality of life. As a consequence, there is a concern about functional rehabilitation, since the aging of this population is already a reality in our environment. Thus, the objective of this project is to evaluate the effects of functional rehabilitation on quality of life in adult patients over 18 years of SCA. In this longitudinal intervention study, patients will be submitted to a three-month rehabilitation program. Before and after the intervention, patients will be submitted to the following assessments: spirometry; quality of life questionnaire - Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36); functional scale of joint integrity - Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS); fatigue assessment scale - Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F); physical activity assessment questionnaire - International Physical Activity Questionaire (IPAQ); peripheral muscle assessment (handgrip and isometric dynamometry of the quadriceps muscle); and 6-minute walk test (6MWT).

SCD-related pain is associated with significant functional impairment, spanning poor school attendance, decreased quality of life, and stress and mood difficulties. Pharmacological approaches are the first-line treatment for SCD-related pain, but these can be costly and have unwanted side effects. Given limitations from pharmacological approaches and the influence that poor behavioral responses have on disease management and health outcomes suggest a critical need for alternative and adjunctive treatments. Due to gaps in available behavioral treatments specifically designed for addressing common challenges associated with pain management in pediatric SCD, the investigators developed a manualized behavioral therapy protocol by tailoring existing evidence-based treatments. The overall goal of the intervention is to reduce the impact of pain on daily functioning in pediatric SCD. This study will empirically test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of this intervention for youth with SCD. Children and adolescents with SCD between the ages of 8 and 17 years old (n=20) will be recruited to complete the treatment protocol.

Several studies have shown that these pregnancies are marked by maternal morbidity due to acute sickling crises, thromboembolism, infection, chronic end-organ dysfunction, or pre-eclampsia (PE), while neonatal outcomes may be intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), preterm delivery, small infants for gestational age, stillbirth, and neonatal death.

Consequently, monitoring pregnancies in sickle cell patients represents a complex medical challenge due to the risk of potentially serious maternal and fetal complications. Multidisciplinary follow-up is then crucial to monitor and manage these possible complications.

NCT04808778,Stroke Prevention in Young Adults With Sickle Cell Anemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04808778,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic disease, affecting about 25 million people worldwide. Approximately 150,000 Nigerian children are born each year with sickle cell disease (SCD), making it the country with the largest burden of SCD in the world. Recent advancements in care for children with SCA have translated into improved survival of children in both high and low-resource settings. However, more complications of SCD are seen in those who survive to adulthood. Silent cerebral infarcts (SCI) and strokes are among the most devastating complications of SCD, affecting 40% and 10% of children, respectively.

The overall goal of this study is to extend the Investigator's successful capacity-building effort in the assessment of neurological morbidity in children with SCD living in northern Nigeria (Kano) to young adults with SCD living in the same region. About 50% of all adults with SCD live in Nigeria. Despite the high prevalence of SCD in Africa, the neurological morbidity is not well characterized, limiting opportunities for primary and secondary stroke prevention strategies. At least 50% of young adults with sickle cell anemia (SCA), the most severe form of the disease, will have SCIs and an estimated 10% will have strokes, based on studies in high-resource settings. In high-resource settings, screening for abnormal transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities in children with SCA, coupled with regular blood transfusion has resulted in a 92% reduction of relative risk for strokes. Despite this effective strategy, regular blood transfusion therapy does not seem sustainable in sub-Saharan Africa due to shortages and the risk of transfusion transmissible infections. Additionally, there is a lack of evidence-based stroke prevention strategies in young adults with SCA, either in the high-income or in low-resource settings. Based on the foregoing, the Investigators propose to determine the prevalence of neurological injury (overt stroke, transient ischemic attacks, and silent cerebral infarcts) in young adults at the transition age from 16-25 years.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder of the blood. SCD causes red blood cells (RBCs) to die early. This can lead to a shortage of healthy cells. SCD and other blood disorders can be managed with drugs or cured with a bone marrow transplant. Researchers want to know how long RBCs survive in people with SCD and other blood disorders before and after treatment compared to those who had a bone marrow transplant.

Objective:

To learn how long RBCs survive in the body in people with SCD and other blood disorders compared to those whose disease was cured with a bone marrow transplant.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 years or older with SCD or another inherited blood disorder. People whose SCD or blood disorder was cured with a bone marrow transplant are also needed.

Design:

Participants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood and urine tests.

Participants will have about 7 tablespoons of blood drawn. In the lab, this blood will be mixed with a vitamin called biotin. Biotin sticks to the outside of RBCs. This process is called ""biotin labeling of RBCs."" The next day, the participant s own biotin-labeled RBCs will be returned to their bloodstream.

Participants will return regularly to have smaller blood samples (about 2 teaspoons) drawn. These samples will be tested to detect the percentage of cells that have biotin labels. These visits may be every 2 weeks, 4 weeks, or some other interval. Participants will continue this schedule for up to 20 weeks or until biotin can no longer be detected....",NO,Sickle Cell Disease|Thalassemia|Hemoglobinopathy,BIOLOGICAL: Biotin-labeled red blood cells,"To determine and compare red blood cell survival, by virtue of the mean number of days of detectable biotin-labeled RBCs, in participants with SCD and/or other hemoglobinopathies., Enumeration of biotin-labeled RBCS (BioRBCs) will be performed by flow cytometry.

Even when it is clear that alloBMT can give to these patients an improvement in their disease, myeloablative transplants have important toxicities and mortalities associated. The lack of suitable donors continues to be a limit to access to transplantation. Substantial progress has been made recently in the development of pre-treatment regimens that facilitate the sustained engraftment of donor marrow with reduced toxicity. Most of these regimens incorporate highly immunosuppressive drugs, which allow the reduction or elimination of myeloablative agents or total body irradiation without endangering the sustained engraftment of HLA-identical allogeneic stem cells. Preliminary results of non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation suggest that the procedure can be performed in patients who are ineligible for myeloablative alloBMT, and that sustained remissions of several hematologic malignancies can be obtained.",YES,Sickle Cell Disease|Hemoglobinopathies,DRUG: Thymoglobulin|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide (CTX)|DRUG: Mesna|DRUG: Sirolimus|DRUG: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)|PROCEDURE: Bone marrow transplantation|RADIATION: Total body irradiation,"Transplant-related Mortality (TRM), Defined as death in the absence of recurrent sickle cell disease or hemoglobinopathy, at 1 year after BMT","Number of Patients Who Developed Grade I-IV Acute Graft-vs.-Host Disease, GVHD Severity was graded using the established National Institutes of Health's consensus criteria \[36\]., 2 years|Number of Patients With Donor Hematopoietic Chimerism in Peripheral Blood <95% at 6 Months After Mini-haploBMT, Partially human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched bone marrow from first-degree relatives.

People with asthma have difficulty breathing, wheeze (a whistling noise when breathing), cough, produce sputum or phlegm, and have inflammation (swelling, irritation, redness) and narrowing of the bronchial tubes.

When a person has both asthma and sickle cell disease together, more serious medical problems can occur such as having acute chest syndrome and pain episodes more often. It is sometimes hard to diagnose asthma in a person with sickle cell disease because sickle cell disease can also cause lung problems.

The purpose of this study is to see if the investigators can better understand asthma when it occurs in a person who has sickle cell disease. The investigators will do this by taking a blood, urine, and saliva sample. The blood and urine samples will be analyzed for chemicals and DNA (genes).

Painful vasoocclusive crisis (VOC) occurs in people with sickle cell disease (SCD). People with VOC have many visits to the hospital. About 10 30 percent of these people will go on to develop acute chest syndrome (ACS). ACS can cause further ill health. It can also cause death. Researchers want to find ways to diagnose ACS more quickly. To do this, they want to use stored blood samples and scans from a study (the DeNOVO trial) that was closed in 2015. They want to see if scans and samples taken of people with VOC who later developed ACS could help diagnose ACS faster. The data of people in the DeNOVO study who did not develop ACS will serve as controls.

Objectives:

To look at data from the DeNOVO trial to find a way to diagnose ACS more quickly.

Eligibility:

People 10 85 years old who took part in NHLBI Protocol number 05-H-0019 (the DeNOVO trial). The trial lasted from 2004 to 2008. The study was closed in November 2015.

These painful episodes are thought to result from ischemia caused when small blood vessels are occluded by misshapen, inflexible erythrocytes. Painful episodes are the most common cause of hospitalization, morbidity, and impairment for SCD patients. There is no therapy that completely prevents or directly aborts painful events for all patients. Consequently, treatment for acute VOC is primarily supportive using hydration and medicinal pain control. Every pain medication has the potential to relieve pain but is associated with significant limitations and side effects.

The primary hypothesis to be tested in this double blind, randomized controlled trial is that Nalbuphine is equivalent to morphine for pain control and patients will suffer fewer episodes of acute chest syndrome. The investigators also expect subjects will report fewer side effects from respiratory depression, abdominal distention from reduced peristalsis, reduced histamine release causing pruritis and still be provided adequate pain control.

NCT02989701,Pilot and Feasibility Trial of Plerixafor for Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) Mobilization in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease Pilot and Feasibility Trial of Plerixafor for Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) Mobilization in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02989701,COMPLETED,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common genetic diseases in the world. In North America, an estimated 2600 babies are born with SCD each year1, and approximately 70,000 to 100,000 individuals of all ages are affected in the United States2. The clinical manifestations of SCD include acute events, such as recurrent debilitating painful crises, as well as life-threatening pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic complications. The only established curative treatment for SCD patients is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Unfortunately, access to this intervention is limited by availability of suitable matched donors, and HSCT is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. For patients who cannot undergo HSCT, treatment of SCD has been limited to one FDA-approved medication, hydroxyurea, and supportive symptomatic care. After decades with very few novel therapeutic options for SCD patients, autologous cell-based genetic therapies, including lentiviral-based gene therapy as well as gene editing, now offer the possibility of innovative curative approaches for patients lacking a matched donor for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Gene therapy for sickle cell disease is increasingly promising, and there are currently open clinical trials at several centers that employ a gene addition strategy.

Options for autologous HSC collection include bone marrow harvest or peripheral blood HSC mobilization. Bone marrow (BM) harvest is an invasive procedure requiring anesthesia, which is associated with sickle cell-related morbidities, and may not achieve goal CD34+ cell dose, necessitating repeated procedures scheduled over multiple months. In most gene therapy trials, HSCs are obtained through peripheral collection after mobilization with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) followed by peripheral blood (PB) apheresis. However, this approach is contraindicated in SCD because G-CSF has been reported to cause severe adverse effects in sickle cell patients. Even with doses sometimes smaller than standard, G-CSF has been shown to result in vaso-occlusive crises, severe acute chest syndrome, and in one report, massive splenomegaly and death. Alternative options for mobilization are needed.

Objectives:

Primary: Evaluate the analgesic effect of Paracoxib versus Morphine in SCD vaso-occlusive crises.

Secondary: Reduce opioid use/dependence, decrease the length of hospital stays, and monitor side effects related to Paracoxib.

Methodology: A double-blinded randomized controlled trial, conducted in a tertiary care emergency department. The study includes adult SCD patients with moderate to severe crises, excluding non-VOC pain, certain medications, and specific medical conditions. The sample size is 226 patients, split equally into two groups.

Intervention: Patients receive either Morphine or Paracoxib, with periodic assessment of vital signs and pain. Additional Morphine is administered if required. Data collection and analysis are meticulously planned.

NCT04587661,Designing an Implementation Strategy for Delivering Routine Mental Health Screening and Treatment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04587661,TERMINATED,"African Americans living with chronic health conditions are more likely to experience depression and other mental health disorders than their healthy counterparts, and are more likely to experience severe depression than whites, but less likely to be diagnosed or receive treatment. One especially vulnerable group is patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), a genetic blood disorder that primarily affects people of African descent, many of whom live in disadvantaged circumstances and are cared for in under-resourced settings. SCD causes severe acute and chronic pain, end-organ damage, and early mortality. Patients transitioning from adolescence to adulthood (ages16-30) are at high risk for mental health disorders and suicide.

Using mobile technology, the investigators can provide high-quality, evidence-based behavioral mental health treatment that reaches patients in different settings. Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for treating depression and anxiety and can be brought to scale at low cost. Despite the promise of digital CBT, there are barriers to its widespread use, particularly in low-resource settings serving minorities. Qualitative data show that cultural factors-lack of relatability, representation, and perceived stigma regarding mental health treatment-limit engagement with digital CBT programs. Population-and setting-specific adaptations to interventions can lead to their successful implementation and wider use. The investigators will work with a digital CBT program to decrease stigma and make it more relatable and relevant to young adults with SCD, by devising changes to advertising and promotion, and tailoring communication with an integrated health coach, Aim 1: Use implementation science (ImS) and human-centered design methods to define the barriers to delivering routine mental health screening and digital CBT to adolescents and young adults with SCD. Aim 2: Rapidly iterate, test, and evaluate adaptations to the implementation strategy for a coach-enhanced digital mental health service. Aim 3: Demonstrate that a population-specific implementation strategy improves engagement with a digital CBT-based mental health service.

NCT03572036,Phosphodiesterase Type-5 Inhibitor Therapy in Sickle Cell People With Pulmonary Hypertension,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03572036,COMPLETED,"Background:

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common inherited blood disorder. Many people with SCD are at risk to get pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH means that the blood pressure in the blood vessels to the lungs is high, and is a serious disease and. Very few studies have looked at the success of treatments for PH in people with SCD. Researchers want to learn more about treating PH with a type of drug called phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-I). They will look at the records of people who have already joined other studies.

Objective:

To identify people who already joined NIH SCD protocols whose medical records should be reviewed. The review will look at the description of SCD patients with PH who have already taken PDE5-I and the outcomes for these people.

Eligibility:

Adults ages 18 and older with SCD and PH. They must have joined certain NIH studies and taken PDE5-I therapy for at least 16 weeks.

Design:

This study is a review of medical records.

Researchers will collect data from databases of existing studies. They will identify people in those studies who have SCD and PH and took the study drug for at least 16 weeks.

Researchers will review the full medical records of those people.

From that review, researchers will find participants who meet the inclusion criteria. They will extract data from those records.

The aim of this trial is to compare the tolerability and acceptability of supervised bimonthly treatment with either sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP+AQ) or mefloquine plus artesunate (MQ+AS), with the daily proguanil. Two hundred and seventy patients with sickle cell disease attending the paediatric sickle cell disease clinic in Ilorin hospital who meet the eligibility criteria and have parental consent, will be randomized to one of three prophylactic regimens: daily proguanil, bimonthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine, or bimonthly mefloquine plus artesunate. Patients will be asked to return to clinic every two months and whenever they are sick. At enrollment, the study paediatrician will conduct a physical examination of the child, and collect a venous blood sample for a complete blood cell count and biochemical screen, determination of G6PD genotype, preparation of blood smears for malaria microscopy and a blood spot for determination of molecular markers of resistance.

One especially vital organ affected in SCD is the brain. Individuals with SCD have an increased risk of both overt cerebral infarctions and silent infarctions. The latter are brain lesions without apparent neurological sequelae. Since cortical neurons in the brain lack the ability to regenerate, tissue damage accumulates throughout the already shortened lifespan of individuals with SCD, resulting in far-reaching consequences such as significant cognitive impairment. Currently, only hematological stem cell transplantation can halt the multiorgan tissue damage. However, the criteria to determine the timing of curative therapy do not center the brain, despite that subtle anomalies of this critical organ can have long-lasting consequences. Since it is not yet known whether brain tissue damage precedes, parallels, or lags behind non-brain tissue damage, it is critical to map these effects in youth with SCD. While importantly comparing images with a healthy reference population. Understanding how the brain is affected is critical for clinical decision making, such as timing of potentially curative interventions but also, to prevent long term irreversible brain damage in youth with SCD. In this study, a cohort of 84 SCD patients between the ages of 6 and 18 at baseline, will undergo MR imaging, neurological examination, neuropsychological assessment and blood sampling three times in total, with intervals of two years; results will be innovatively compared with children included in the Generation R population study (±8000 MRIs children and (young)adults) 6-20 years of age).

Further, it is unclear what proportion of parents treated in our setting would elect to receive formal assistance with quitting smoking or consider alternative approaches that could facilitate eventual smoking cessation.

Some parent smokers may be unlikely to participate in an intervention aimed only at cessation but would be willing to participate in an intervention focused on establishing smoke-free environments for their child. Parents are typically not offered a choice regarding the type of intervention they receive and many interventions are not tailored to their readiness to quit smoking or designed to reach multiple family members in the home who may also smoke. Quitting smoking and establishing smoke-free homes and cars are distinct, yet challenging, goals for parents and families.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes the abnormal clotting of blood in a deep vein of the upper or lower limbs (deep vein thrombosis) that may travel to and block a blood vessel in the lung (pulmonary embolism). Some people with sickle cell disease (SCD)-a red blood cell disorder-seem to be at greater risk for developing these blood clots. Researchers want to study the blood of people with SCD and VTE as well as healthy people to develop better treatments to prevent blood clots.

Objective:

To study blood clotting in SCD because it is the most common cause of vascular death after a heart attack or stroke.

Eligibility:

People ages 18-80 who have SCD (with or without a history of blood clots) or the trait for SCD, and healthy volunteers

Design:

Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and medical records review. They will give blood samples.

Participants will have phone calls either every 3 months or once a year, for 2 years. They will give updates on their health. They may give additional medical records. The phone calls may last up to 30 minutes.

If participants have a VTE or pain crisis episode, they may visit the Clinical Center. These visits may last up to 4 hours. They will repeat the screening tests and give blood samples.

Some participants may be invited to take part in blood studies.

The patients enrolled in this study will be those who lack matched sibling donors and therefore have no other option but to undergo bone marrow transplantation using matched but unrelated bone marrow or umbilical cord blood from the national marrow donor program registry. Since bone marrow transplantation for these disorders using matched unrelated donors has two major problems i.e. engraftment, or , the process of new marrow being accepted and allowed to grow in the the patient; and graft-versus-host disease, or the process where the new marrow ""rejects"" the host or the patient, this study has been devised with methods to overcome these two problems and thus make transplantation from unrelated donors both successful in terms of engraftment and safe in terms of side effects, both acute and long term.

In order to accomplish these two goals, two important things will be done. Firstly, patients will get three medicines which are considered reduced intensity because they are not known to cause the serious organ damage seen with conventional chemotherapy. These medicines, however, do cause intense immune suppression so these can cause increased infections. Secondly, in addition to transplantation of bone marrow from unrelated donors, patients will also transplanted with mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the bone marrow of their parents. Mesenchymal stromal cells are adult stem cells that are normally found in the bone marrow and are thought to create the right background for the blood cells to grow. They have been shown in many animal and human studies to improve engraftment. In addition, they have a special property by which they prevent and are now even considered to treat graft versus host disease. Therefore, by using a reduced intensity chemotherapy regimen before transplant and transplanting mesenchymal stromal cells, we hope to improve engraftment while at the same time decrease the potential for severe side effects associated with a conventional transplant which uses extremely high doses of chemotherapy.",YES,Sickle Cell Disease|Thalassemia|Diamond-Blackfan Anemia,PROCEDURE: Bone marrow transplantation|BIOLOGICAL: Mesenchymal Stromal Cells,"Count of Participants With Stable Engraftment Post Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT), Stable engraftment was defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>500 cells /µL for 3 consecutive days and platelet count \>50,000 for one week without transfusion; subsequently stable engraftment was measured by percentage of donor cells., Up to 1 year","Overall Survival 6 Months Following HCT, Overall survival is reported at the count of participants alive 6 months following HCT., 6 months|Overall Survival 1 Year Following HCT, Overall survival is reported at the count of participants alive 1 year following HCT., 1 year|Count of Participants With Disease-free Survival 6 Months Following HCT, Disease-free survival is defined as alive without underlying disease., 6 months|Count of Participants With Disease-free Survival 1 Year Following HCT, Disease-free survival is defined as alive without underlying disease., 1 year",,Stanford University,University of Minnesota|University of Alabama at Birmingham,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",PHASE2,6,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2009-03,2013-08,2013-08,"Children's Hospital of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama, 35233, United States|University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55455, United States",

We will test our hypothesis that a novel nonmyeloablative condition regimen will be safe and efficacious in producing stable donor chimerism and cure of severe hemoglobinopathy:

Specific Aim 2: Optimize the immunosuppressive regimen for HSCT patients through a thorough understanding of the pharmacokinetics of Busulfan (BU) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in the patient population. This will involve:

1. Determine the pharmacokinetics of intravenously and orally administered MMF and intravenous BU in patients receiving HSCT.
2. Determine the relationship of Area under the curve (AUC) of BU and mean trough concentrations of mycophenolic acid (MPA) to engraftment and graft versus host disease (GVHD).
3. Determine the relationship of Area under the curve (AUC) and steady state concentration of BU to engraftment at day 30 and 1 year post HSCT.

Specific Aim 3: Study the effect of complete or partial donor chimerism on silent and overt cerebral vasculopathy, and neurocognitive functioning in patients with SCD undergoing HSCT. We will test our hypothesis that stable donor chimerism will result in improvement in cerebral vasculopathy and neurocognitive function. This will include.

1. Determine effect of transplantation silent and overt cerebral vasculopathy by comparison MRA and TCD 1 year after HSCT to pre-HSCT studies.
2. Determine effect on HSCT on neurocognitive function.

Nevertheless, it was observed that, the sickle cell trait is associated with serious medical complications especially during intense physical efforts. Moreover, the exposure to a hot environment (tropical climate) is suspected to be a determining factor in the occurrence of these medical complications.

However, the relationship between sickle cell trait and death during effort is not well established. Furthermore, the cascade of events that usually cause sickle cell crisis such as red blood cells sickling and rhabdomyolysis and which affect microcirculation are not known.

Our main objective in this study is to verify whether young healthy active men with sickle cell trait have reactive hyperemia to their hemoglobinemic condition during exercise; to identify the contribution of hot environment on these possible disturbances; and to determine underlying mechanisms.

In addition, disturbances in the regulation of glucose metabolism in healthy subjects under hot environment have been reported, marked by a significant increase in postprandial blood glucose. Therefore, this project is also intended to assess the contribution of the disturbance of glycoregulation during exercise under hot environment in active sickle cell trait carriers. The imbalance of pro and anti oxidant agents, the adhesion and inflammation markers will also be evaluated.

Sickle cell anemia is an illness where the red blood cells change shape and can clog up blood vessels. This keeps the body from getting the oxygen it needs. Thalassemia is when the body does not make enough hemoglobin, something that helps the oxygen get to the places it needs to go in the body. The patient may or may not need to get regular blood transfusions (getting more blood) to improve their quality of life (feel better) and prevent organ damage (problems with the brain, heart, lung, kidney, and gonad, for example.). The transfusions can also cause problems, including iron overload (too much iron in the blood), which can be fatal (patients can die) without regular deferoxamine shots. Even with the best usual treatments, people with thalassemia or SCD die sooner. There is no proven cure.

We would like to treat patients using bone marrow transplantation, a treatment that has been used for people with SCD. The transplant uses healthy ""matched"" bone marrow. This comes from a brother or sister who does not have sickle cell disease or severe thalassemia. If the treatment works, the sickle cell disease or thalassemia may be cured. This treatment has been used to treat patients with sickle cell disease or thalassemia. It has worked in most cases. We hope, but cannot promise, that the transplanted marrow will make healthy cells, and patients will not have sickle cell disease or severe thalassemia anymore.

Although various treatments are available during painful episodes, the medication most commonly given for pain is a pain medication such as morphine. Fluids are also used. Even with these treatments, many children still have severe pain that is difficult to control. In addition to pain medications, there are other medications that may be useful. Methylprednisolone (solumedrol) and prednisone are a group of medications called steroids that may be helpful for painful episodes. These medications are known to lower the amount of inflammation (this means swelling, tenderness, and soreness) in the body. Because this medication may help with your pain, you are being asked to be a part of this study. These types of medications are used in other illnesses such as asthma, especially during times when the illness has gotten worse.

The main purpose of this study is to see if the methylprednisolone and prednisone will lower the amount of pain and the length of hospital stay.

In addition to the pain medication you will normally receive, you will be assigned to one of 2 groups: 1) the experimental group with the active form of the medicine, or 2) a comparison group without the active form of the medicine.

Increases in another type of (normal) hemoglobin, fetal globin (HbF), which is normally silenced in infancy, reduces anemia and morbidity. Even incremental augmentation of fetal globin is established to reduce red blood cell pathology, anemia, certain complications, and to improve survival.

This trial will evaluate an oral drug discovered in a high throughput screen, which increases fetal globin protein (HbF and red blood cells expressing HbF)and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to high levels in anemic nonhuman primates and in transgenic mice. The study drug acts by suppressing 4 repressors of the fetal globin gene promoter in progenitor cells from patients.

NCT03502421,Ketamine Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03502421,WITHDRAWN,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) often results in acute vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), an obstruction of blood vessels resulting in ischemic injury and pain. The pain experienced during these episodes is due to a wide range of pathophysiological processes. Though recent studies have begun to unravel the underlying mechanisms of these processes, literature focused on pain management for sickle cell disease is scarce. Opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) remain the predominate treatment for VOC.

However, the efficacy of these treatments has come into question. A large sub-set of patients with SCD report continued pain despite treatment with opioids. Tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) may be responsible for unresponsiveness to opioid-centric treatment modalities. New classes of drugs are being tested to prevent and treat acute pain associated with SCD, but in the meantime physicians are looking to existing therapies to bridge the gap.

The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been implicated in both tolerance and OIH. As a NMDA receptor agonist, ketamine has been shown to modulate opioid tolerance and OIH in animal models and clinical settings. Ketamine utilized as a low dose continuous infusion could benefit patients with SCD related pain that are unresponsive to opioid analgesics. Based on limited studies of adjuvant ketamine use for pain management, low-dose ketamine continuous infusion appears safe. Further clinical investigations are warranted to fully support the use of low-dose ketamine infusion in patients with SCD-related pain.",NO,"SC Disease|Pain, Chronic",DRUG: Ketamine,"Total opioid Use in milligrams morphine equivalents, Total opioid Use in milligrams morphine equivalents, 1-3 hours|Pain scores measured on the Visual Analog Scale 0 - 10, Pain scores measured on the Visual Analog Scale 0 - 10, 1-3 hours","Cost of pharmacotherapy, monetary cost of intervention used, 1 day|Length of hospital stay, Length of stay in the hospital, 1-7 days|Nausea and vomiting scores Visual Analog Scale 0 - 10, Nausea and vomiting scores Visual Analog Scale 0 - 10, 1-3 hours",,University of South Florida,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,0,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2018-09-01,2019-09-01,2019-11-01,,

NCT04157179,Cerebral Oxygen Metabolism in Children,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04157179,RECRUITING,"The purpose of this research study is to better understand how blood flow and metabolism change can influence brain development in the early decades of life.

We will examine brain blood flow and metabolism using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The brain's blood vessels expand and constrict to regulate blood flow based on the brain's needs. The amount of expanding and contracting the blood vessels can do varies by age. The brain's blood flow changes in small ways during everyday activities, such as normal brain growth, exercise, or deep concentration. Significant illness or psychological stress may increase the brain's metabolic demand or cause other bigger changes in blood flow. If blood vessels are not able to expand to give more blood flow when metabolic demand is high, the brain may not get all of the oxygen it needs. In extreme circumstances, if the brain is unable to get enough oxygen for a long time, a stroke may occur. Sometimes small strokes occur without other noticeable changes and are only detectable on an MRI. These are sometimes called ""silent strokes."" In less extreme circumstances, not having as much oxygen as it wants may cause the brain to grow and develop more slowly than it should.

One way to test the ability of blood vessels to expand is by measuring blood flow while breathing in carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide causes blood vessels in the brain to dilate without increasing brain metabolism.

During this study participants may be asked to undergo a blood draw, MRI, and potential neuropsychological assessments. It is also possible that the study team will use a special mask to control the amount of carbon dioxide the participants breathe in so they don't breathe in too much.",NO,Sickle Cell Disease|Cerebral Stroke,OTHER: Carbon Dioxide,"Cerebral Oxygen Metabolism, From the beginning of the MRI scan to the completion of the MRI scan -- 75 minutes.","Cerebrovascular Reactivity, From administration of carbon dioxide to end of inhalation of carbon dioxide -- 15 minutes.",,Washington University School of Medicine,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",NA,350,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,2019-10-17,2027-12,2027-12,"Washington University of St. Louis, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States",

NCT00270478,Hydroxyurea and Erythropoietin to Treat Sickle Cell Anemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00270478,COMPLETED,"This study will examine the use of hydroxyurea and erythropoietin for treating sickle cell disease in patients who also have kidney disease or pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs). Hydroxyurea increases production of fetal hemoglobin in the red blood cells of patients with sickle cell disease, reducing the amount of sickle cells that cause pain and other complications requiring hospitalizations. However, hydroxyurea treatment has limitations: patients with sickle cell disease who have developed kidney disease may not be able to get the full benefit of the medicine, and hydroxyurea alone may not be able to treat life-threatening complications such as pulmonary hypertension or stroke. This study will determine which of two dosing schedules of hydroxyurea and erythropoietin is more effective for treating patients with sickle cell disease who also have kidney disease or pulmonary hypertension, and will examine whether the two drugs can lower blood pressure in the lungs.

Patients 18 years of age and older with sickle cell anemia and kidney disease or pulmonary hypertension, or both, may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood tests, a 6-minute walk test (test to see how far the subject can walk in 6 minutes), and echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart to measure blood pressure in the lungs).

Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

Stabilization Phase: Patients take 2 hydroxyurea tablets a day until their fetal hemoglobin levels stabilize, usually over 2 to 4 months. They have blood tests every 2 weeks to monitor hemoglobin and fetal hemoglobin levels. At some time during this period, they undergo a test to measure kidney function, in which they are injected with an iodine-containing dye and wear a small pump for 1 day that injects a small amount of dye under the skin over 24 hours. They come to the clinic for 2 or 3 blood tests collected over 4 hours.

Sequence I (Standard): When the fetal hemoglobin levels have been stable for 2 months, patients have a repeat echocardiogram and 6-minute walk test. Erythropoietin is then added to the hydroxyurea regimen. It is given 3 days a week, as an injection under the skin, along with iron supplements. Patients have blood tests and blood pressure measurements every week or every other week. Patients with pulmonary hypertension have another echocardiogram and 6-minute walk test once the hemoglobin level is stable.

Sequence II (Cycled): When hemoglobin levels have stabilized with hydroxyurea once a day and erythropoietin 3 times a week, the hydroxyurea is adjusted so that the amount taken in 7 days is ""cycled"" over 4 days, and the erythropoietin is cycled over 3 days, with the dose increased twice, every 3 to 4 weeks. Blood pressure and hemoglobin are monitored once or twice a month. Patients with pulmonary hypertension have another echocardiogram and 6-minute walk test once the hemoglobin level is stable.

NCT04594031,US Phase I Study of ECT-001-CB in Patients With Sickle-Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04594031,WITHDRAWN,"The application of experimental hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) therapy in sickle-cell disease (SCD) must strike a balance between the underlying disease severity and the possibility of a direct benefit of the treatment, particularly in pediatric populations. Clinical studies in adults with SCD have focused on interventions that prolong survival and improve the quality of life. Unlike children, adults with SCD are much more likely to have a debilitating complication. As a result, the risk/benefit ratio of HCT is very favorable in adults, particularly if an approach to HCT that defines an acceptable level of toxicity can be established.

Whereas hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative treatment currently available for patients with SCD, the morbidity, the frequent irreversible damage in target organs and the mortality reported in the natural course of patients with severe SCD are strong incentives to perform HSCTs in younger age groups. For those who lack a matched related donor, CB transplant is an appealing option, but despite been less problematic, CB accessibility related to cell dose of appropriately matched cord blood unit (CBU) remains a significant issue. Through a 7-day culture process of a CBU's hematopoietic stem cell HSCs with the UM171 compound, the total cell dose is increased mitigating this limitation.

UM171-CB expansion (ECT-001-CB) allows a greater CB accessibility, the selection of better matched cords that might translate into favourable clinical outcomes as reported in previous trials, including a lower risk of graft-versus-host disease. After CB selection and ex-vivo expansion, ECT-001-CB transplant will follow a myeloablative reduced-toxicity conditioning regimen consisting of rATG, busulfan and fludarabine with doses of all agents optimized to the individual using model-based dosing and will be followed by standard supportive care and GVHD prophylaxis consisting of tacrolimus and MMF.",NO,Sickle Cell Disease|Umbilical Cord Blood|Hematopoietic Cell Proliferation,BIOLOGICAL: ECT-001-CB (UM171-Expanded Cord Blood Transplant),"Evaluate feasibility of finding a suitable ECT-001-CB graft for transplantation in the context of SCD., Calculate the proportion of recruited SCD patients for whom a suitable CBU (i.e., ≥ 6/8 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) with an appropriate cell dose) is identified., Up to 24-months|Evaluate feasibility of a successfully performing ECT-001-CB transplantation in the context of SCD., Calculate the percentage of selected grafts that will be successfully expanded and transplanted with absence of technical hurdles, During accrual (up to 24-months)|Evaluate the Safety of ECT-001-CB by evaluating tri-lineage hematopoietic reconstitution, Measure the time required to achieve neutrophil and platelet engraftment, Up to 12-Months|Evaluate the Safety of ECT-001-CB by calculating incidence of acute and chronic GvHD, Calculate incidence of Acute GVHD and Chronic GVHD as per NIH criteria, Up to 12-Months|Evaluate the Safety of ECT-001-CB by evaluating adverse events, Calculate the Incidence of Adverse Events from the beginning of the conditioning regimen up to 12 months after ECT-001-CB transplant, Up to 12-Months|Evaluate the Safety of ECT-001-CB by evaluating incidence of transplant related mortality (TRM), Calculate incidence of any mortality related to the investigational product until the end of evaluation period., Up to 12-Months|Evaluate the Safety of ECT-001-CB by incidence of graft failure, Calculate the incidence of primary and late graft failure, Up to 100 days","Determine the pharmacologic effect of ECT-001-CB by evaluating donor chimerism, The percentage of hematopoietic chimerism, based on DNA polymorphisms, will be measured and compared to baseline., Up to 12-Months post treatment|Determine the pharmacologic effect of ECT-001-CB by measuring sickle hemoglobin (HbS) in peripheral blood., The concentration of the Sickle Hemoglobin (HbS) will be compared to baseline., Up to 12-Months post treatment|Evaluate impact of ECT-001-CB on SCD-related events during the study period., The incidence of SCD-related adverse events will be compared to internal controls, Up to 12-Months post treatment",,ExCellThera inc.,California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM),ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",PHASE1,0,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2021-07-13,2023-09-01,2024-02-02,"Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California, 94304, United States|University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, 94158, United States",

ACS is associated with airway inflammation, and a major cause is pulmonary infection from atypical organisms. To date, there are no drugs available to reduce inflammation and risk of recurrent ACS. Macrolides are a group of antibiotics that exert immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory actions both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, macrolides reduce bacterial burden in the airway of atypical organisms, all of which play an important role in the pathophysiology of ACS. Numerous studies have evaluated macrolide prophylaxis in conditions associated with lung inflammation, such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, bronchiectasis etc., and high quality evidence have found macrolides to be beneficial as a disease modifying agent that leads to improvement in airway inflammation, reduced pulmonary exacerbations and improved lung function.

Background:

People with sickle cell disease (SCD) have many health challenges. Also, they often have trouble sleeping. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) might help people with SCD to improve their sleep problems.

Objective:

To see how well ACT works in people with SCD and sleep problems and to find out how they feel about it.

Eligibility:

People between the ages of 18 and 55 with SCD and trouble sleeping.

Design:

The study is remote. Participants will not have to come to the NIH at all. They will need a device that has Bluetooth and can connect to the internet.

Some participants will be in the study for 12 weeks. Others will participate for 20 weeks.

Participants will video chat with an ACT coach once a week for 8 weeks. The coach will guide participants through mindfulness exercises and teach ACT ideas. Each session lasts about 45 minutes.

Participants will be loaned an actigraph, a device worn on the wrist like a watch that measures and records movement. They will download a free app to upload data from the actigraph for the researchers.

Participants will wear the actigraph on their nondominant wrist day and night for either 4 or 6 designated weeks. During these weeks, participants will complete a sleep diary each morning when they wake up. This takes about 2 minutes.

Participants will be sent other surveys to complete from home during the study. They will answer questions about their physical and emotional health. These take 20-25 minutes.

Some people with the same disorder on a genetic level have more complications than others. Researchers want to look for a link between the PKLR gene and sickle cell disease (SCD) symptoms. The PKLR gene helps create a protein, called pyruvate kinase that is essential in normal functioning of the red blood cell. Differences in the PKLR gene, called genetic variants, may cause some changes in the pyruvate kinase protein and other proteins, that can affect functioning of the red blood cell adding to the effect of SCD. Researchers can study these differences by looking at DNA (the material that determines inherited characteristics).

Objective:

To study how the PKLR gene affects sickle cell disease.

Eligibility:

Adults ages 18-80 of African descent. They may have sickle cell disease or not. They must not have had a transfusion recently or have a known deficiency of pyruvate kinase. They cannot be pregnant.

Design:

Participants will be screened with questions.

Participants will have blood drawn by needle in an arm vein. The blood will be genetically tested. Not much is known about how genes affect SCD, so the test results will not be shared with participants or their doctors.

NCT07001631,Effect of EMDR for Reduction of Pain Interference in Children With Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07001631,RECRUITING,"Children with sickle cell disease may experience frequent painful episodes. This, together with the traumatic experiences during a hospitalization, can lead to the development of posttraumatic stress reactions. As the stress can trigger painful episodes (pain crisis) in children with sickle cell disease, the investigators think that treating these stress symptoms can reduce the pain-related problems in their lives. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is proven to be an effective trauma treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder. Research studies show that EMDR can reduce pain in adults. The investigators want to study now if EMDR effective is in reducing pain-related problems in children with sickle cell disease.",NO,"Sickle Cell Disease|Pain|Pain, Chronic Disease",OTHER: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR),"Pain interference, The PROMIS Short Form - Pain Interference 8a for measuring Pain Interference will be used. The PROMIS Pain Interference questionnaire assesses the pain impact on relevant aspects of one's life. This includes the extent to which pain affects social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. It also incorporates items probing sleep and enjoyment in life. The questionnaire assesses pain interference over the past seven days (recall period). A higher PROMIS T-score represents more pain interference. This scale ranges from 0 to 100 points. In his dissertation, Luijten reports that the general Dutch pediatric population reports a mean score of 39 points with a standard deviation of 10 points. Therefore, T-scores of 49 and above represent a (sub)clinical level of functioning.

It measures potentially traumatic events and PTSD symptoms (PTSS). The questionnaire consists of 15 items measuring traumatic events, 20 items measuring DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and 5 items measuring psychosocial functioning, and it is administered in approximately 15 minutes. The 4-point symptom response scales indicate the reported frequency/severity of each symptom.

For children aged 6-7 years, using the caregiver-report version, the possible score range is 0-48, and the recommended cut-off point indicative of (sub)clinically relevant levels of symptoms is 12 points or more.

It is characterized by many complications, the most dreaded of which are related to pregnancy - affecting both the mother and unborn child. Compared to those without SCD, people with SCD have more adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO): 6x maternal mortality, 2x preeclampsia \& preterm birth, 4x risk of having a baby not growing well in the womb \& stillbirth. There is also greater need for access to care (7x higher hospitalization often multiple times lasting days to months). Yet up to 30% of SCD pregnancies are uncomplicated.

Treatments in pregnancy are limited and carry risks. A method to distinguish pregnancies at high-risk of APO that may benefit from these potentially risky treatments, from those likely to be uncomplicated, is urgently needed. To meet this need, the investigators developed a calculator to estimate pregnancy complication risk, using single-centre data. Its accuracy and precision will now be evaluated with international information from several centers by testing the calculator, and adjusting it as needed, using already available pregnancy-data from study centres in several countries. Those age \>16 years, who have a confirmed SCD genotype, pregnancy with one baby, and pregnancy care and birth at a participating study centre will be included. Pregnancy care for the participants will be up to their doctors, with no changes based on the study.

It has a lot of complications including neurological complications. The neurological complications of SCD are particularly devastating and lead to cognitive decline even in the absence of overt brain injury. In such cases, it is thought that inflammation in the brain maybe partly responsible for the cognitive decline.

The main reasons for this research study are to see 1) how safe and 2) how well minocycline works to try to stop/reverse cognitive decline in people with SCD. People with SCD are at risk for changes in their brain over time that can cause problems with learning, memory, and attention. Part of the reason for this is inflammation within the brain. Minocycline may be able to stop these brain changes by stopping this brain inflammation.

Minocycline is a second-generation tetracycline antibiotic that has been shown to both inhibit neuroinflammation and improve cognitive function in a variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders but has not yet been studied in SCD. We are proposing here, a pilot double-blinded, randomized controlled trial to examine the tolerability and early efficacy of minocycline in adults with SCD at two dosing regimens (200 mg and 300 mg daily) versus placebo over one year.

Gene therapy is a relatively new field of medicine that uses genetic material (mostly DNA) from the patient to treat his or her own disease. In gene therapy, the investigators introduce new genetic material in order to fix or replace a diseased gene, with the goal of curing the disease. The procedure is similar to a bone marrow transplant, in that the patient's malfunctioning blood stem cells are reduced or eliminated using chemotherapy, but it is different because instead of using a different person's (donor) blood stem cells for the transplant, the patient's own blood stem cells are given back after the new genetic material has been introduced into those cells. This approach has the advantage of eliminating any risk of Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), reducing the risk of graft rejection, and may also allow less chemotherapy to be utilized for the conditioning portion of the transplant procedure. The method used to fix or replace a diseased gene is called gene editing. A person's own cells are edited using a specialized biological medicine that has been formulated for use in human beings.

Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is a healthy, non-sickling kind of hemoglobin. Investigators have recently discovered a gene called BCL11A that is very important in the control of fetal hemoglobin expression.

- Some treatments for cancer or other diseases can lead to infertility in women. These treatments include chemotherapy, some stem cell transplants, and pelvic radiotherapy. They are called gonadotoxic therapies. Women can now have their eggs frozen before they have these treatments. This may allow them to get pregnant later. Researchers want to learn more about this technology and processes.

Objectives:

- To provide egg freezing for women having gonadotoxic therapies at NIH. To learn more about the effects of these therapies.

Eligibility:

- Women at least 18 years old who are past puberty and before menopause. They must be scheduled to have gonadotoxic therapies.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with medical history and blood and hormone tests. They will also have a physical exam and transvaginal ultrasound.
* Ovary stimulation: participants will have medications injected under the skin. These increase the chance of fertility. This phase will take about 8 20 days. Participants will have blood drawn and transvaginal ultrasound daily or every other day. Some participants will also have blood thinner injected daily.
* Egg retrieval: participants will check in to the hospital. Eggs will be removed with a needle during a short surgery. Participants will be awake but sedated.
* Participants may stay overnight in the hospital.
* They will return every 1 3 days for 1 3 weeks for blood tests.
* Mature eggs will be frozen after egg retrieval and immature eggs (which cannot be fertilized for clinical use) will be used for research.

Iron accumulates in several organs in the body, such as the heart, liver, endocrine glands (pancreas, thyroid, etc.), and spleen. Excessive iron can damage organs and may even cause death. Iron overload needs to be appropriately monitored and treated to avoid unnecessary morbidity and mortality.

The present study, GENIOS, proposes to test prospectively the hypothesis that genetic modifiers influence the iron overload status of patients receiving transfusions. To test this hypothesis, the study will perform genetic studies to investigate possible genetic influences for iron accumulation in the body and will study iron accumulation not only in the liver, but also in the heart, pancreas, kidneys, and spleen. In addition: the study will investigate if these same genes have any role during treatment of iron overload, in other words, if certain genetic mutations will influence how iron exits the body. This study will also investigate how substances that are known to control the trafficking of iron in and out of the body and its damaging effects to the tissues (hepcidin and non transferrin-bound iron) are linked to the accumulation of iron in the heart and liver. Iron in the body will be measured by R2\*MRI and no liver biopsies will be required. Genetic studies will be done by specialized tests using peripheral blood DNA.

Advances in the field of technology provide potential avenues for innovative and improved care models for our patients. Virtual reality (VR) has been recently utilized to improve anxiety and pain in a variety of patient populations including children undergoing elective surgery and children experiencing intravenous cannulation in the Emergency Department. Patients with SCD and cancer, both adults and children, are a group of patients that can benefit from VR as part of their care. Over the past four years, our team has successfully implemented several self-developed mobile applications (""apps"") for our patients, in addition to integrating objective data (heart rate, activity, stress) from wearable activity trackers. The investigators now propose implementing a feasibility study followed by a pilot study and randomized-controlled trial of the use of VR in patients with SCD and cancer.

NCT01441141,Genetics and Pain Severity in Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01441141,COMPLETED,"Background:

- Pain is the most common symptom of sickle cell disease. Episodes of severe sickle cell pain are known as ""crises."" High rates of pain crises are associated with a higher risk of early death. Some people with sickle cell disease have many severe pain crises while others experience fewer crises. This difference in pain crisis may be caused by sensitivity to pain. People with high sensitivity to pain may have more pain crises. Many factors, including a person's genetic makeup, determine sensitivity to pain. Comparing genetic information from people with sickle cell disease and healthy volunteers may provide more information on pain and sickle cell disease.

Objectives:

- To study genetics and pain sensitivity in sickle cell disease.

Eligibility:

* African or African American individuals at least 18 years of age with sickle cell disease.
* Healthy African or African American volunteers at least 18 years of age.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also provide blood and urine samples.
* Participants will have the following tests:
* Quantitative sensory testing to measure sensitivity to pressure, heat, cold, and mechanical pain.
* EndoPat test to measure blood vessel function and reaction.
* Questionnaires about mood, evidence of depression, pain, quality of sleep, and sleep disturbances.
* Measures of daily pain, whether or not related to sickle cell disease.

NCT01443728,Vitamin D for Sickle-cell Respiratory Complications,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01443728,COMPLETED,"This study aims to answer the question whether oral vitamin D supplementation can decrease lung complications in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease. Lung complications are the leading causes of morbidity and of death in sickle cell disease. Infections and increased inflammation play important roles in the development of the lung problems in sickle cell disease. Emerging evidence shows that vitamin D helps the immune system to fight infection and to control inflammation and could potentially help prevent respiratory complications in patients with sickle cell disease. The investigators hypothesize that oral vitamin D3, 100,000 IU (2.5 mg), given once a month to a group of children and adolescents with sickle cell disease, will reduce the rate of respiratory events (infection, asthma exacerbation and acute chest syndrome) compared to the rate in a group given standard dose oral vitamin D3, 12,000 IU (0.3 mg) given once a month.

Mortality for children with SCD has decreased substantially over the past 4 decades, with \>99% of those born in high resource settings, including the United States, France, and England, now surviving to 18 years of age. However, the life expectancy of adults with SCD is severely shortened. Dysfunction of the heart, lung, and kidney is directly associated with decreased life expectancy. With the variety of curative therapies that are now available for SCD, long-term health outcomes studies are time-sensitive. As of now, efforts to determine long-term health outcomes following curative therapies for SCD have been limited. Though curative therapies initially should provide a cure for symptoms of SCD, there is the risk of late health outcomes to consider. Defining health outcomes following curative therapy is essential to improve personalized decision-making when considering curative versus disease-modifying therapeutic options. The primary goal of this study is to determine whether curative therapies for individuals with SCD will result in improved or worsening heart, lung, and kidney damage when compared to individuals with SCD receiving standard therapy. The investigators will also explore whether certain genes are associated with a good or bad outcome after curative therapy for SCD.",NO,Sickle Cell Disease|Pulmonary Disease|Renal Disease|Heart Disease,,"Measurement of longitudinal change in FEV1, Measurements of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) based on the global lung index will be acquired from children with SCD receiving myeloablative curative therapies and adults with SCD receiving nonmyeloablative allo-HSCT, as well as from the respective control children and adult cohorts with SCD who received standard therapy.

Among patients with SCD who had suffered from at least one ischemic stroke, the prevalence of moya moya syndrome was estimated up to 43%. In general, therapeutic strategies in Moya Moya to prevent first ever ou recurrent stroke can be divided into conservative medical treatment and surgical revascularisation (direct bypass, indirect bypass or combined bypass).

NCT01036802,Anticoagulation For Pulmonary Hypertension in Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01036802,TERMINATED,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is often referred to as a hypercoagulable state. However, the contribution of coagulation activation to the pathogenesis of SCD remains uncertain. Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is a common complication associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Autopsy studies of SCD patients with PHT show evidence of in situ thrombosis involving pulmonary vessels, similar to findings in non-sickle cell patients with PHT. Anticoagulation has been reported to be of benefit in non-sickle cell patients with PHT. With the evidence of increased coagulation activation in SCD, PHT represents a clinical endpoint that may be used to evaluate the contribution of coagulation activation to the pathophysiology of SCD. The investigators hypothesize that increased thrombin generation, as well as platelet activation are central to the pathophysiology of SCD and contribute to the occurrence of several SCD-related complications, including PHT.

NCT04121247,Nonpharmacological Approaches and Parental Education in Children With Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04121247,COMPLETED,"Aim: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary disease. Approximately 5% of the world's population carries trait genes for haemoglobin disorders, mainly, sickle-cell disease and thalassaemia. The incidence of sickle cell disease varies according to different geographical locations. Persons with SCD experience both acute and chronic pain. it is important that nonpharmacological therapies be investigated and used as complements to pharmacological therapies to address and treat both acute and chronic pain for those with SCD. An educational program involving parents with children with SCD can help parents use nonpharmacological methods for their children in reducing pain. The training program allows parents to develop their knowledge of the SCD and the importance of non-pharmacological methods, and may provide parents with the opportunity to develop preventive attitudes towards reducing pain crises. The research has two purposes. The first is to identify the non-pharmacological approaches that parents use to help their children with sickle cell disease in Turkey, Chad. Second, to determine the effectiveness of non-pharmacological approaches given to parents in Turkey, Chad.

Method: This study is an experimental research method using a quasi-experimental design. This study used a pretest and posttest, with a design that is used is the two group pretest-posttest design. The study was conducted on the parents of children with sickle cell disease diagnosed and followed up in the Pediatric Hematology Oncology polyclinics of two hospitals in Chad in Central Africa between September 2015 and February 2016. The study found in April 2016 and July 2016 between Turkey's southern Antalya and Mersin two university hospital outpatient Children's pediatric hematology oncology has made clinic on sickle cell disease diagnosed and monitored the children's parents.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic illness. It affects about 100,000 people in the United States. People with SCD have red blood cells that are sickle-shaped and impaired in their function. This results in a lifetime of complications that affect every organ system. People with SCD also are at greater risk for respiratory infections and lung problems. Researchers want to study how this population s stress, anxiety, fear, pain, sleep, and health care use are being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Objective:

To study the extent and impact of life changes induced by the COVID-19 pandemic on people living with SCD in the U.S.

Eligibility:

People age 18 and older with SCD who live in the U.S.

Design:

Participants will complete a survey online. The questions will focus on the following:

Medical history

Mental and physical health

Demographics

Stress

Resilience

Health care use

COVID-19

Beliefs about medical mistrust and participation in research.

At the end of the survey, participants will be asked if they would like to take the survey again in the future.

NCT03975894,TAPS2 Transfusion Antenatally in Pregnant Women With SCD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03975894,UNKNOWN,"Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a serious inherited blood disorder affecting red blood cells. When oxygen levels drop the red cells become abnormally shaped and unable to move through the blood vessels easily. Blood and oxygen do not reach body organs, resulting in episodes of severe pain and other complications. Pregnant women with SCD have an increased risk of both sickle and pregnancy complications, including raised blood pressure. Their babies may grow more slowly in the womb, are more likely to be born early and need special care, and have a higher risk of dying. The only treatments currently available for women with SCD are Hydroxycarbamide (which cannot be used during pregnancy) and blood transfusion. Currently, blood transfusion is only used during pregnancy to treat emergency complications. It has been suggested that giving blood transfusions throughout pregnancy could improve outcomes for both mother and babies. In Serial Prophylactic Exchange Blood Transfusion (SPEBT), sickle blood is mechanically removed and simultaneously replaced with donor red cells. A trial is needed to assess SPEBT given every 6-10 weeks, starting before 18 weeks of pregnancy, compared to standard care. This trial will evaluate outcomes for women (e.g. hospital admission, frequency of crisis) and their infants (e.g. early delivery, birthweight). However, the feasibility of such a study needs to be assessed before embarking on a large multicentre trial. This study is therefore a feasibility study in which we will randomly allocate participants to have either SPEBT or standard care.

When deoxygenated, the sickle haemoglobin (HbS) polymerizes inducing the sickling of red blood cells (RBCs) and leading to decreased deformability and increased fragility. Therefore, sickle RBCs exhibit a reduced lifespan associated with intravascular hemolysis, hemolytic anemia and low tissue oxygenation. Sickle RBCs, which exhibit abnormal adhesive properties to endothelial cells, can block the microcirculation, causing the occurrence of painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), acute chest syndrome (ACS), acute and chronic organ damage (heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, bone...) and shortened life span.

A preliminary study performed on RBC from sickle cell patients (Hb SS) has shown an alteration of a parameter measuring the overall deformability of RBCs by evaluating the nature of their movement in a shear flow. This parameter is significantly lower in sickle cell patients in steady state compared to a population of healthy individuals. The parameter is also significantly lower in sickle cell patients during VOC when compared to patient in steady state.

NCT05253781,Low Dose Aspirin for Preventing Intrauterine Growth Restriction and Preeclampsia in Sickle Cell Pregnancy (PIPSICKLE),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05253781,COMPLETED,"Pregnancy in sickle cell disease (SCD) is fraught with many complications including preeclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Previously, the investigators found an abnormality in prostacyclin-thromboxane ratio in sickle cell pregnant women, a situation that is also found in non-sickle pregnancies with PE and unexplained IUGR. Low dose aspirin (LDA) has been found to reduce the incidence of PE and IUGR in high-risk women due to its reduction of vasoconstrictor thromboxane whilst sparing prostacyclin, in effect ""correcting"" the ratio. It has been found to be safe for use in pregnancy and is recommended in obstetric guidelines for this use but has not been tested in sickle cell pregnancy. The investigators hypothesize that LDA would reduce the incidence of IUGR and PE in pregnant haemoglobin (Hb)SS women. The investigators also plan to build a machine-learning model to predict severe maternal outcomes in them.

The investigators propose a multi-site, randomized, controlled, double blind trial comparing a daily dose of 100mg aspirin with placebo, from 12 - 28 weeks gestation until 36 weeks. The study sites are three teaching hospitals in Lagos and Ile-Ife, and twelve general hospitals and one federal medical centre within Lagos state, with the coordinating centre at the College of Medicine, University of Lagos (CMUL), Idi-Araba, Lagos. A total of 476 eligible pregnant HbSS and HbSC women will be recruited consecutively and randomly assigned to either group using a web-based app, sealed envelope. Each study group will comprise 238 pregnant women with SCD.

All participants will be followed from recruitment till six weeks postpartum. They will have their body weight, blood pressure and haematocrit checked at each antenatal visit. Their full blood count, vital signs and oxygen saturation will be checked and recorded at each visit. Primary outcome measure will be birth weight below 10th centile for gestational age on INTERGROWTH 21 birthweight charts, and incidence of miscarriage or perinatal death. Analysis will be by intention to treat, and the main treatment effects will be quantified by relative risk with 95% confidence intervals, at a 5% significance level.

Currently, there is no etiologic treatment to abort ACS. Therefore, management of ACS mostly involve a symptomatic approach including in routine, and as per recommendations, hydration, analgesics, supplemental oxygen, and transfusion.

The polymerisation of sickle haemoglobin (HbS) is one major feature in the pathogenesis of vaso-occlusion. Current guidelines recommend red blood cell exchange transfusion (REX) in patients with severe ACS in order to improve oxygenation and reduce HbS concentration to blunt sickling. REX is often preferred over simple transfusion in this setting because it rapidly reduces HbS without raising final haematocrit. There are currently two methods for REX: manual (with sequential phlebotomies and transfusions) or automated (erythrocytapheresis). The former allows a sober use of red blood cell packs, while the latter achieves haematological targets (HbS and haematocrit) quickly and more consistently, but requires a special equipment and trained staff. As a result of inflammation and intravascular hemolysis, the plasma of patients with ACS may also contain several components that promote vaso-occlusion, lung injury and organ failure, including cytokines (e.g., IL-6), free haemoglobin and free haem. Conversely, it is depleted in haptoglobin and hemopexin, which normally bind to and clear cell-free haemoglobin. The addition of therapeutic plasma exchange to erythrocytapheresis during automated REX may therefore have a dual beneficial effect in patients with overt intravascular hemolysis: i) deplete the inflammatory mediators and products of hemolysis; ii) replete haptoglobin and hemopexin.

NCT05952817,Effect of Virtual Reality on Pain and Function in Children With Sickle Cell Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05952817,COMPLETED,"Significance or rationale of the study:

Virtual reality (VR) is a promising non-pharmacological pain management tool. It enhances motor function by promoting cortical reorganization and neuroplasticity. Its multimodal biofeedback engages sensory and cognitive functions, making therapy interactive, motivating, and easy to understand. With strong rehabilitation potential, VR helps patients adapt to real-world movements (Laver, 2020). Initially used for procedural pain management, VR is now expanding into chronic pain rehabilitation by encouraging engagement with difficult or avoided movements (Griffin et al., 2020). Additionally, VR offers a dynamic alternative to traditional exercises, improving adherence and outcomes. Integrating entertainment into therapy can motivate children, enhancing their physical and psychological well-being. Recently, a few studies revealed an improvement in vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) after VR treatment (Agrawal et al., 2019). However, efficacy studies are needed to assess VR's potential benefits. Additionally, data regarding VR's efficacy on daily pain, functional mobility, and HRQOL as complementary therapy are limited",NO,SCD,DEVICE: virtual reality,"Pain Intensity (Numeric Rating Scale - NRS), Pain intensity was assessed using the validated Arabic version of the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), which ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain).

NCT05359991,Exercise in Child Health,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05359991,RECRUITING,"This study is a cooperative investigation funded by the NIH. The project is a collaboration among three major NIH Clinical Translational Science Awardees: 1) UCI (lead site with its affiliate CHOC), 2) Northwestern University (with its affiliate Lurie Children's Hospital), and 3) USC (with its affiliate Children's Hospital of Los Angeles).

There is an increasing number of children who, through medical advances, now survive diseases and conditions that were once fatal, but which remain chronic and debilitating. A major challenge to improve both the immediate and long term care and health of such children has been the gap in our understanding of how to assess the biological effects of exercise. Like otherwise healthy children, children with chronic diseases and disabilities want to be physically active. The challenge is to determine what constitutes safe and beneficial level of physical activity when the underlying disease or condition \[e.g., cystic fibrosis (CF) or sickle cell disease (SCD)\] imposes physiological constraints on exercise that are not present in otherwise healthy children. Current exercise testing protocols were based on studies of athletes and high performing healthy individuals and were designed to test limits of performance at very high-intensity, unphysiological, maximal effort. These approaches are not optimal for children and adolescents with disease and disability. This project (REACH-Revamping Exercise Assessment in Child Health) is designed to address this gap. Cohorts of children will be identified with two major genetic diseases (CF and SCD) and measure exercise responses annually as they progress from early puberty to mid or late puberty over a 3-4year period. In addition, in the light of the pandemic, a group of children will be added who were affected by SARS-CoV-2 and investigate their responses to exercise. SARS-CoV-2 has similar long-term symptoms than CF and SCD have. Novel approaches to assessing physiological responses to exercise using advanced data analytics will be examined in relation to metrics of habitual physical activity, circulating biomarkers of inflammation and growth, leukocyte gene expression, and the impact of the underlying CF, SCD or SARS-CoV-2 condition.

Patients at the highest risk include the elderly (\>50 in our population), those with a history of respiratory or cardiac disease and those with other comorbidities. Several patients affected by RBCDs undergo splenectomy as therapeutic option to improve their level of hemoglobin concentration. Splenectomized patients, or in the case of SCD with functional hyposplenism, are more vulnerable to bacterial infections / superinfections after viral infection. Acute pulmonary syndrome (ACS) is the main cause of morbidity in SCD in middle-high income countries, and is often triggered by infectious events. Currently, there is no literature on the subject. Thus, any recommendation available comes from the experience gained with previous Coronaviruses infections. Accordingly, the correct treatment and management of infection by Coronavirus SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) in patients affected by RBCDs may be challenging given the rapid spread of the pandemic and limited literature so far, especially in some countries. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to pool evidence in a unique repository on patients affected by RBCDs and COVID-19 in order to reach critical numbers to facilitate the medical decision making process across Europe.

Objectives:

- To see if imatinib and carvedilol are safe and effective treatments for high blood pressure in the lungs in adults with sickle cell disease.

Eligibility:

- Adults at least 18 years of age who have sickle cell disease and have or may have high blood pressure in the lungs.

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have different tests of heart and lung function, including a walking test and imaging studies. Blood and urine samples will also be collected.
* Participants who meet specific criteria will take one of two possible study drugs. Those who receive imatinib will take it daily. Those who receive carvedilol will take it twice a day.
* Participants will have weekly study visits for blood tests and other exams. The study drug dose will be adjusted at each weekly visit. It will be increased slowly to reach a target dose(based on the participant s weight) or to find a stable effective dose.
* Participants may continue to take their study drug for up to 24 weeks, with weekly study visits. Regular blood samples and heart and lung function tests will be performed.

NCT01241357,High-Tc Susceptometer to Monitor Transfusional Iron Overload,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01241357,COMPLETED,"The proposed research project will continue the application and development of a new method (biomagnetic susceptometry) that measures magnetic fields to determine how much iron is in the liver. The amount of iron in the liver is the best indicator of the amount of iron in the whole body. Measuring the amount of iron in the body is important because either too much (iron overload) or too little iron (iron deficiency) can be harmful. At present, the most reliable way to measure the amount of iron in the liver is to remove a sample of the liver by biopsy, either by surgery or by using a needle which pierces the skin and liver. Iron stored in the liver can be magnetized to a small degree when placed in a magnetic field. In patients with iron overload, the investigators previous studies have shown that magnetic measurements of liver iron in patients with iron overload are quantitatively equivalent to biochemical determinations on tissue obtained by biopsy. In the past the investigators have developed a device to measure the amount of magnetization, which was called a SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device) susceptometer. This device was validated and in use for over 20 years. The safety, ease, rapidity and comfort of magnetic measurements make frequent, serial studies technically feasible and practically acceptable to patients. The investigators have now developed a new susceptometer, which uses very similar technology to the SQUID, but the investigators believe is more accurate and precise. This study aims to validate this new instrument.

NCT00040456,"Oral Magnesium Pidolate, Hemoglobin SC Disease, MG Pidolate",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00040456,TERMINATED,"Subjects have a form of sickle cell disease, called hemoglobin SC disease. This results in abnormally shaped red blood cells that get 'stuck' in blood vessels and then results in episodes of severe pain (pain crises). Patients with the more common form of sickle cell disease, called hemoglobin SS disease, also suffer from pain crises. Treatment with the drug hydroxyurea is available to help prevent the pain crises in hemoglobin SS disease, but there is no good treatment to help prevent the pain crises in hemoglobin SC disease.

It has been shown that one of the reasons for the formation of the abnormally shaped red blood cells in patients with SC disease is the fact that these cells do not contain enough water; they are dehydrated. Drinking more water will not increase the amount of water in the cells. Certain salts and minerals can however have an effect on the amount of water in the red blood cells. One of the most important minerals influencing this is called magnesium. Magnesium is present in food and also in certain medications used to treat heartburn. Magnesium has been used successfully both in animals and people to increase the amount of water in the red blood cells and is very well tolerated by most people.

Investigators are using a new form of magnesium known as magnesium pidolate because this form of magnesium may help with the symptoms of disease without causing diarrhea (a common side effect of magnesium products).

Purpose The purpose of this study is to find out whether treatment with magnesium pidolate will increase the amount of water in the red blood cell and result in fewer painful crises in patients with hemoglobin SC disease while not causing diarrhea.

NCT01319851,Alefacept and Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01319851,TERMINATED,"Allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation remains the only viable cure for children who suffer from many serious non-malignant hematological diseases. Transplantation, however, carries a high risk of fatal complications. Much of the risk stems from the use of high dose radiation and chemotherapy for conditioning, the treatment administered just prior to transplant that eliminates the patients' marrow and immune system, effectively preventing rejection of the donors' cells. Attempts to make blood and marrow transplantation safer for children with non-malignant diseases by using lower doses of radiation and chemotherapy have largely failed because of a high rate of graft rejection.

In many such cases, it is likely that the graft is rejected because the recipient is sensitized to proteins on donor cells, including bone marrow cells, by blood transfusions. The formation of memory immune cells is a hallmark of sensitization, and these memory cells are relatively insensitive to chemotherapy and radiation. Alefacept, a drug used to treat psoriasis, on the other hand, selectively depletes these cells.

NCT06250595,European Rare Blood Disorders Platform (ENROL),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06250595,RECRUITING,"ENROL, the European Rare Blood Disorders Platform has been conceived in the core of ERN-EuroBloodNet as an umbrella for both new and already existing registries on Rare Hematological Diseases (RHDs). ENROL aims at avoiding fragmentation of data by promoting the standards for patient registries' interoperability released by the EU RD platform.

ENROL's principle is to maximize public benefit from data on RHDs opened up through the platform with the only restriction needed to guarantee patient rights and confidentiality, in agreement with EU regulations for cross-border sharing of personal data.

Accordingly, ENROL will map the EU-level demographics, survival rates, diagnosis methods, genetic information, main clinical manifestations, and treatments in order to obtain epidemiological figures and identify trial cohorts for basic and clinical research. To this aim, ENROL will connect and facilitate the upgrading of existing RHD registries, while promoting the building of new ones when / where lacking. Target-driven actions will be carried out in collaboration with EURORDIS for educating patients and families about the benefits of enrolment in such registries, including different cultural and linguistic strategies.

The standardized collection and monitoring of disease-specific healthcare outcomes through the ENROL user-friendly platform will determine how specialized care is delivered, where are the gaps in diagnosis, care, or treatment and where best to allocate financial, technical, or human resources.

Moreover, it will allow for promoting research, especially for those issues that remain unanswered or sub-optimally addressed by the scientific community; furthermore, it will allow promoting clinical trials for new drugs. ENROL will enable the generation of evidence for better healthcare for RHD patients in the EU as the ultimate goal.

ENROL officially started on 1st June 2020 with a duration of 36 months.

NCT04398628,ATHN Transcends: A Natural History Study of Non-Neoplastic Hematologic Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04398628,RECRUITING,"In parallel with the growth of American Thrombosis and Hemostasis Network's (ATHN) clinical studies, the number of new therapies for all congenital and acquired hematologic conditions, not just those for bleeding and clotting disorders, is increasing significantly. Some of the recently FDA-approved therapies for congenital and acquired hematologic conditions have yet to demonstrate long-term safety and effectiveness beyond the pivotal trials that led to their approval. In addition, results from well-controlled, pivotal studies often cannot be replicated once a therapy has been approved for general use.(1,2,3,4) In 2019 alone, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued approvals for twenty-four new therapies for congenital and acquired hematologic conditions.(5) In addition, almost 10,000 new studies for hematologic diseases are currently registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov.(6) With this increase in potential new therapies on the horizon, it is imperative that clinicians and clinical researchers in the field of non-neoplastic hematology have a uniform, secure, unbiased, and enduring method to collect long-term safety and efficacy data.

ATHN Transcends is a cohort study to determine the safety, effectiveness, and practice of therapies used in the treatment of participants with congenital or acquired non-neoplastic blood disorders and connective tissue disorders with bleeding tendency. The study consists of 7 cohorts with additional study ""arms"" and ""modules"" branching off from the cohorts.

The overarching objective of this longitudinal, observational study is to characterize the safety, effectiveness and practice of treatments for all people with congenital and acquired hematologic disorders in the US.

NCT02720679,Investigation of the Genetics of Hematologic Diseases,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02720679,RECRUITING,"The purpose of this study is to collect and store samples and health information for current and future research to learn more about the causes and treatment of blood diseases. This is not a therapeutic or diagnostic protocol for clinical purposes. Blood, bone marrow, hair follicles, nail clippings, urine, saliva and buccal swabs, left over tissue, as well as health information will be used to study and learn about blood diseases by using genetic and/or genomic research. In general, genetic research studies specific genes of an individual; genomic research studies the complete genetic makeup of an individual.

It is not known why many people have blood diseases, because not all genes causing these diseases have been found. It is also not known why some people with the same disease are sicker than others, but this may be related to their genes. By studying the genomes in individuals with blood diseases and their family members, the investigators hope to learn more about how diseases develop and respond to treatment which may provide new and better ways to diagnose and treat blood diseases.

Primary Objective:

* Establish a repository of DNA and cryopreserved blood cells with linked clinical information from individuals with non-malignant blood diseases and biologically-related family members, in conjunction with the existing St. Jude biorepository, to conduct genomic and functional studies to facilitate secondary objectives.

Secondary Objectives:

* Utilize next generation genomic sequencing technologies to Identify novel genetic alternations that associate with disease status in individuals with unexplained non-malignant blood diseases.
* Use genomic approaches to identify modifier genes in individuals with defined monogenic non-malignant blood diseases.
* Use genomic approaches to identify genetic variants associated with treatment outcomes and toxicities for individuals with non-malignant blood disease.
* Use single cell genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics to investigate biomarkers for disease progression, sickle cell disease (SCD) pain events and the long-term cellular and molecular effects of hydroxyurea therapy.
* Using longitudinal assessment of clinical and genetic, study the long-term outcomes and evolving genetic changes in non-malignant blood diseases.

Exploratory Objectives

* Determine whether analysis of select patient-derived bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor/stem (HSPC) cells or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can recapitulate genotype-phenotype relationships and provide insight into disease mechanisms.
* Determine whether analysis of circulating mature blood cells and their progenitors from selected patients with suspected or proven genetic hematological disorders can recapitulate genotype-phenotype relationships and provide insight into disease mechanisms.",NO,Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes|Erythrocyte Disorder|Leukocyte Disorder|Hemostasis|Blood Coagulation Disorder|Sickle Cell Disease|Dyskeratosis Congenita|Diamond-Blackfan Anemia|Congenital Thrombocytopenia|Severe Congenital Neutropenia|Fanconi Anemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Myeloproliferative Diseases,,"Percent of participants who agree to participate, It is estimated that approximately 30% of participants (proband) approached for this study will agree to participate and that each proband will have approximately five biologically-related family members who agree to participate., Day 1, at enrollment","Number by type of inherited genetic aberrations associated with hematologic disorders, Germ-line DNA samples from study participants will be extracted and analyzed in order to identify inherited genetic aberrations associated with hematologic disorders.

NCT04330183,Low Dose Ketamine and Acute Pain Crisis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04330183,COMPLETED,"BACKGROUND:

Current treatment standard for acute pain crisis in sickle cell disease (SCD) is largely supportive care: opioid analgesics, hydration, oxygen, and blood transfusion. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic condition associated with serious and disabling acute consequences such as a vaso-occlusive (VOC) or pain crisis. Uncontrolled pain is the hallmark of a VOC, and often results in acute unscheduled care in the patient's clinic or hospital emergency department (ED). During these pain crises, patients sometimes require high doses of opioids for analgesia. Opioid analgesics are fraught with challenges including the development of tolerance, dependence, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (whereby the use of opioids actually makes patients more sensitive to pain). Finding non-opioid alternatives for intravenous analgesia is problematic based on the limited availability this class of drugs. Ketamine is a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that even at low doses has demonstrated efficacy as an adjunct to opioids for acute pain control.

OBJECTIVE:

The investigators will determine the comparative efficacy of low doses of ketamine as an adjunct to opioids versus standard care (opioids alone) for the treatment of acute severe pain in patients with sickle cell related pain crisis.

METHODS:

The investigators propose a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study to determine the efficacy of ketamine 0.3mg/kg vs. placebo for the treatment of acute pain crisis. The investigators will include all eligible emergency department ≥18 years. The investigators will stratify 42 patients by location, 21 patients per site. Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) will be recorded as a part of the study log at 0, 1, 2 and 3hrs after the study drug administration.

HYPOTHESIS:

The investigators hypothesize that the ketamine will decrease overall pain intensity, visit length of stay, and hospitalizations.",NO,Sickle Cell Crisis,DRUG: Ketamine|DRUG: Normal Saline,"Pain intensity, We anticipate a decrease in numeric pain score after ketamine administration, 4 hours","Emergency department length of stay, We anticipate a decrease in the LOS in the ED, 4 hours",,Rhode Island Hospital,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE4,20,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2020-07-01,2021-10-01,2021-10-01,"Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island, 02905, United States|The Miriam Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island, 02906, United States",

NCT01758042,Bone Marrow and Kidney Transplant for Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease and Blood Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01758042,RECRUITING,"The main purpose of this study is to examine the outcome of a combined bone marrow and kidney transplant from a partially matched related (haploidentical or ""haplo"") donor. This is a pilot study, you are being asked to participate because you have a blood disorder and kidney disease. The aim of the combined transplant is to treat both your underlying blood disorder and kidney disease. We expect to have about 10 people participate in this study.

Additionally, because the same person who is donating the kidney will also be donating the bone marrow, there may be a smaller chance of kidney rejection and less need for long-term use of anti-rejection drugs.

Traditionally, very strong cancer treatment drugs (chemotherapy) and radiation are used to prepare a subject's body for bone marrow transplant. This is associated with a high risk for serious complications, even in subjects without kidney disease. This therapy can be toxic to the liver, lungs, mucous membranes, and intestines. Additionally, it is believed that standard therapy may be associated with a higher risk of a complication called graft versus host disease (GVHD) where the new donor cells attack the recipient's normal body. Recently, less intense chemotherapy and radiation regimens have been employed (these are called reduced intensity regimens) which cause less injury and GVHD to patients, and thus, have allowed older and less healthy patients to undergo bone marrow transplant. In this study, a reduced intensity regimen of chemotherapy and radiation will be used with the intent of producing fewer toxicities than standard therapy.

Typical therapy following a standard kidney transplant includes multiple lifelong medications that aim to prevent the recipient's body from attacking or rejecting the donated kidney. These are called immunosuppressant drugs and they work by ""quieting"" the recipient's immune system to allow the donated kidney to function properly. One goal in our study is to decrease the duration you will need to be on immunosuppressant drugs following your kidney transplant as the bone marrow transplant will provide you with the donor's immune system which should not attack the donor kidney.",NO,Chronic Kidney Disease|Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)|Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)|Hodgkin Disease|Multiple Myeloma|Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)|Aplastic Anemia|AL Amyloidosis|Diamond Blackfan Anemia|Myelofibrosis|Myeloproliferative Disease|Sickle Cell Anemia|Autoimmune Diseases|Thalassemia,PROCEDURE: Haploidentical Bone Marrow/Kidney,"Number of patients who die of treatment-related complications., Assess safety of haploidentical combined bone marrow and kidney transplantation as measured treatment related mortality., 100 days and 1 year post transplant","Number of patients with acute and delayed renal allograft rejection, 2 years post-transplant","Number of patients who are able to discontinue immunosuppressive therapy by one year post transplant, one year post transplant|Number of patients who develop acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD)., post transplant|Number of patients who relapse from their underlying hematological disease, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years post transplant.",Massachusetts General Hospital,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,10,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2012-11,2025-07,2027-07,"Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States",

NCT00352430,Cardiopulmonary Function Assessment and NO-Based Therapies for Patients With Hemolysis-Associated Pulmonary Hypertension,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00352430,COMPLETED,"This study will evaluate new treatments for people who have pulmonary hypertension, or high blood pressure in the lungs, caused by sickle cell anemia or thalassemia.

Patients ages 18 and older with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease or thalassemia, who have mild to severe pulmonary hypertension, and who are not pregnant or breastfeeding may be eligible for this study. There are three stages in the study, with up to 200 participants in the screening. Patients will undergo pulmonary function tests, including those for asthma and measurement of oxygen levels in the arterial blood. They will have a chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan of the lungs, ventilation perfusion lung scan to look for blood clots, echocardiogram, test to measure how far patients can walk in 6 minutes, nighttime oxygen measurement done while asleep, blood collection, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the heart, and exercise test. About 3 to 4 days are needed for the tests, all of which can be done while patients are outpatients, except for the sleep study. For the CT scan, patients lie on a table while an X-ray beam takes images of the lungs and heart. The lung scan involves breathing of a small amount of a radioactive aerosol called Tc99m DTPA while pictures are taken of the lungs from various angles. Then an injection of albumin, a protein with a small amount of radioactivity, will be given, and more lung pictures will be taken. For the MRI scan, patients lie on a table that slides into a machine. A medication called gadolinium will be injected, to help improve images made through the scan. After the tests, patients will be admitted to the Clinical Center for 1 day. A small plastic catheter, or tube, will be placed in the vein of an arm. A longer catheter will go into a deeper vein (neck or leg), and a pulmonary artery catheter will be inserted to measure blood pressure in the blood vessels. Doctors will guide the catheter into the lung artery. Patients will be asked to pedal on a stationary bicycle while heart and lung pressure is measured. If pulmonary hypertension is present, patients will proceed to the second stage (up to 50 participants). While the catheter is still in place, patients will wear a face mask and breathe nitric oxide (NO) for 20 minutes. They will take 50 mg of sildenafil by mouth, and pressure in the heart and lungs will be monitored for about 4 hours. They will again receive NO for another 20 minutes. Blood samples will be taken, and the heart rhythm and pressure in the lungs will be monitored. Sildenafil can cause headache, flushing, and indigestion. Side effects of the lung scan involve allergic reactions to DTPA and albumin. Patients with an allergy to eggs should not have that test.

Up to 25 patients can enter the third stage. They will breathe NO by using a tank of gas that delivers it through tubes to the nose, for a period of 6 weeks. They will continue taking sildenafil as previously prescribed and visit the clinic every 2 to 4 weeks for an echocardiogram, blood tests, and 6-minute walk test. After 6 weeks, patients will have catheterization of the heart again to measure pressure in the heart and lungs. Then NO will be stopped, and pressure in the lungs will be checked to see if NO has helped lower the blood pressure-and to make sure that the blood pressure does not increase when medication is stopped. Patients whose symptoms have improved as a result of breathing NO may wish to continue with that therapy.",NO,Pulmonary Hypertension,DRUG: Nitric Oxide/INP Pulse Delivery|DRUG: Nitric Oxide/INO Pulse Delivery,To assess cardiopulmonary function in patients with sickle cell disease and thalassemia with and without pulmonary hypertension.,"To determine the relative acute vasodilatory effects of sildenafil, and inhaled NO in patients with hemolysis-associated pulmonary hypertension.",,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1,31,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: |Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2006-07-09,2010-03-10,2010-03-10,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States",

NCT03333486,"Fludarabine Phosphate, Cyclophosphamide, Total Body Irradiation, and Donor Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Blood Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03333486,TERMINATED,"This phase II trial studies how well fludarabine phosphate, cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation, and donor stem cell transplant work in treating patients with blood cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells.

NCT01572922,Massive Iron Deposit Assessment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01572922,COMPLETED,"Iron overload is a severe complication of multiple blood transfusions. As the body has no physiologic mechanism for clearing iron, repeated transfusions cause iron accumulation in organs and lead to iron toxicity. Accurate assessment of iron overload is paramount to quantify excessive iron accumulation and to monitor response to iron chelation therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been used to noninvasively measure hepatic iron concentration (HIC). Although MRI-based measurements of transverse relaxation rates (R2 and R2\*) accurately predict biopsy-proven HICs below 15 mg Fe/g, previous studies have shown that their precision is limited for HICs above 15 mg Fe/g and inaccurate above 25 mg Fe/g. Current R2\* gradient-echo (GRE) MR techniques fail occasionally for very high iron overloads (HIC \~ 15-25 mg Fe/g) and always for massive iron overloads (HIC \> 25 mg Fe/g) because R2\* is so high that the MR signal decays before it can be measured accurately.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation has been shown to be curative for many patients with nonmalignant (noncancerous) diseases such as primary immunodeficiency disorders, bone marrow failure syndromes, hemoglobinopathies, and inborn errors of metabolism (metabolic disorders). Powerful chemotherapy drugs and/or radiation are often used to condition the patient before infusion of the new healthy donor cells. The purpose of the conditioning therapy is to destroy the patient's abnormal bone marrow which doesn't work properly in order to make way for the new healthy donor cells which functions normally. Although effective in curing the patient's disease, many hematopoietic cell transplantation regimens use intensive chemotherapy and/or radiation which can be quite toxic, have significant side effects, and can potentially be life-threatening. Investigators are investigating whether a new conditioning regimen that uses less intensive drugs (treosulfan and fludarabine phosphate) with or without low dose radiation results in new blood-forming cells (engraftment) of the new donor cells without increased toxicities in patients with nonmalignant (noncancerous) diseases.",YES,Non-Neoplastic Hematologic and Lymphocytic Disorder,PROCEDURE: Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation|BIOLOGICAL: Anti-Thymocyte Globulin|DRUG: Cyclosporine|DRUG: Fludarabine Phosphate|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Mycophenolate Mofetil|PROCEDURE: Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation|DRUG: Tacrolimus|RADIATION: Total-Body Irradiation|DRUG: Treosulfan|PROCEDURE: Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation,"Preliminary Efficacy, Number of patients engrafted (\>5% donor CD3+ peripheral blood chimerisms) at 1 year following transplant, 1 year following transplant","Non-relapse Mortality, Number of patients who experienced non-relapse mortality by 1 year following transplant, 1 year following transplant|Number of Patients With Grade II-IV Acute Graft-versus-host Disease, Number of patients diagnosed with overall grade II-IV acute GVHD by Day 100 post transplant, Day 100 post transplant|Number of Patients With of Chronic Graft-versus-host Disease, Number of patients diagnosed with chronic GVHD and requiring systemic immunosuppression within 1 year following transplant, 1 year following transplant|Donor Chimerism CD3 at 100 Days Post Transplant, Number of patients with peripheral blood donor chimerism for CD3 less than 5%, 5-49%, 50-94% and greater than or equal to 95% at 100 days post transplant., Day 100 post transplant|Disease Response at One Year Following Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Number of patients with no evidence of disease at one year following transplant, 1 year following transplant|Immune Reconstitution Following Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Number of patients with immune reconstitution (defined by a normal range CD3) at 1 year post transplant, 1 year following transplant|Number of Participants With Infections, Number of participants with clinically significant infections (bacterial, fungal, viral) requiring treatment within 100 days following transplant, 100 days post transplant|Overall Survival, Number of patients alive at 1 year following transplant, 1 year following transplant|Donor Chimerism CD33 at Day 100 Post Transplant, Number of patients with peripheral blood donor chimerism for CD33 less than 5%, 5-49%, 50-94% and greater than or equal to 95% at 100 days post transplant., 100 days post transplant",,Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center,"medac GmbH|National Cancer Institute (NCI)|National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)",ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",PHASE2,98,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2009-07-31,2020-06-10,2020-06-10,"Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, 97239, United States|Vanderbilt University/Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, 37232, United States|Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington, 98105, United States|Fred Hutch/University of Washington Cancer Consortium, Seattle, Washington, 98109, United States|Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53226, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/03/NCT00919503/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"

Its presence in maternal plasma has allowed development of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis for single-gene disorders (SGD-NIPD). This can be performed from 9 weeks of amenorrhea and offers an early, safe and accurate definitive diagnosis without the miscarriage risk associated with invasive procedures. One of the major difficulties is distinguishing fetal genotype in the high background of maternal cfDNA, which leads to several technical and analytical challenges. Besides, unlike noninvasive prenatal testing for aneuploidy, NIPD for monogenic diseases represent a smaller market opportunity, and many cases must be provided on a bespoke, patient- or disease-specific basis. As a result, implementation of SGD-NIPD remained sparse, with most testing being delivered in a research setting.

- Knowing one s family medical history is a part of staying healthy. Some health risks run in families, and knowing these risks can promote more healthy behavior. Different social and cultural factors may affect how family members share this information. Genetic risk information that is shared in one family may not be shared in the same way in another. This information may also be shared differently between spouses, siblings, or parents and children. It may even be shared with more distant relatives. Knowing the information that family members share and how they share it may help researchers improve genetic disease treatment and support plans. Family surveys of people who have genetic health risks may help provide this information.

Objectives:

- To study how family members affected by genetic-related diseases share health information with each other.

* Individuals at least 18 years of age who can read English or Spanish.
* Participants affected by a genetic disease or be related or married to someone who has the disease.

Responses from individual items are summed to give an overall score with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy (ranging from 9 to 45)., Baseline and 12 months|12-month Change in Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM), Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) is a self-reported measure to monitor indicators of current aberrant drug-related behaviors in patients with chronic pain on opioid therapy. Total scores are summed across the 9 individual items and range from 0-36, with higher scores representing greater misuse., Baseline and 12 months|Change From Baseline in Percent of Total Body Area Shaded (Painimation) at 12 Months, Painimation is an electronic pain assessment tool that allows users to better communicate pain symptoms. Patients are provided with a selection of animations (painimations) that they use to describe the quality of their pain. The painimations can be adjusted to reflect pain intensity. Screenshots of the Painimation app illustrate the splash screen, paintable body image, and selection of painimations to indicate the quality and intensity of pain. A higher mean % is indicative of greater pain. For analyses, mean percentages are transformed via arc-sine square in order to normalize., 12 months|Number of Opioid Prescriptions, For patients recruited at one of the six clinical sites, study team will evaluate objectively measured opioid medication prescriptions and refills.
